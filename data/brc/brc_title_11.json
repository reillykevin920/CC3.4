    "verbatim": "11-1-1. Legislative Intent.\n(a)\tThe purpose of this chapter is to define the water utility of the city, to set forth the responsibilities of water service users, and to promote the public health, safety and welfare by adopting a system of plant investment fees that ensures that each new user of city water services pays its proportionate share of the current replacement cost of water facilities. The plant investment fees in this chapter reflect varying service requirements of residential users and are designed to encourage the construction of moderate-income housing.\n(b)\tUtilities should be extended outside the city limits of Boulder consistent with the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan and city charter requirements. The comprehensive plan projects extension of urban services, including utilities, in an orderly fashion in order to ensure the most efficient and cost effective service to the existing utility system.\n(c)\tIt is the intent of the city council to promote efficient water use that is compatible with the city's water supply system, water resource management strategy and the values of the community. The utility will encourage water conservation programs that create incentives for water conservation by users of the water supply of the city, prevent unnecessary depletion of the raw and treated water supply of the city, attempt to supply a continuing level of satisfactory service to existing water utility customers, and ensure the city's ability to meet the present and future basic water needs of the city.\n(d)\tIt is the intent of the city council to create a water rate structure to encourage the efficient use of water and prevent unnecessary depletion of the raw and treated water supply of the city, to attempt to supply a continuing level of satisfactory service to existing water utility customers, to ensure the city's ability to meet the present and future basic water needs of the city, and to pay debt service on any outstanding revenue bonds.\n(e)\tIt is the intent of the city council that it will be a presumptive waste of water if any customer exceeds a properly determined water budget as may be designated from time to time by the city manager.\n(f)\tIt is the intent of the city council to protect public health, safety and welfare and the water supply of the city in the event of an emergency.\n(g)\tIt is the intent of the city council to protect public health, safety and welfare and the water supply of the city in the event of a declaration of drought and to implement water use restrictions and other drought response measures as determined necessary by the city manager to maintain, conserve, replenish or protect the water supply of the city.\n(h)\tThe city council finds and determines that the city has historically provided and will continue to provide water services by means of an enterprise, as that term is defined by Colorado law. The city council further declares its intent that the city's water utility enterprise be operated and maintained so as to exclude its activities from the application of Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.\nOrdinance Nos. 5601 (1993); 7783 (2011); 8547 (2022)"

This will be considered a warning.\n(2)\tFor a second violation within a twelve-month period at the same premises, the city manager shall notify the owner in writing of the violation and that a $100.00 water waste charge is due, payable and collectable pursuant to the provisions of this chapter within ten days of the date of the notice.\n(3)\tFor a third or any subsequent violation within a twelve-month period at the same premises, the city manager shall notify the owner in writing of the violation and that a $300.00 water waste charge is due, payable and collectable pursuant to the provisions of this chapter within ten days of the date of the notice.\n(4)\tThe notice of the first violation warning or water waste charge shall be served no later than thirty days after the city manager learns of the violation and the identity of the owner of the property. Service shall be upon the owner of the property in person or by first class or certified mail addressed to the last known owner of the property on the records of the Boulder County Assessor. The notice shall advise the owner of the right to a hearing under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and that if payment of the water waste charge is not received by the city or a hearing requested within the ten days, the water waste charge, together with a $15.00 administrative processing fee, will appear on the next regular water bill.\n(5)\tThe owner of the property notified of a first violation warning or water waste charge, or any agent of the owner authorized in writing by the owner, may file a written request for a hearing regarding the factual basis for issuing the warning or imposing the charge under the procedures prescribed by Chapter 3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981, within ten days of the date of the notice. The city bears the burden of establishing the factual basis for issuing the first violation warning or imposing the water waste charge by a preponderance of the evidence and, if that basis is established, the hearing officer shall order the charge paid within ten days, subject to the $15.00 administrative fee and the collection procedures of this chapter if not paid within that time. Failure to request a hearing within the time provided or attend any such hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to such hearing and a determination of all issues then existing as supporting the factual basis for imposing the water waste charge.\n(b)\tAdditional Remedies: After three notices have been served upon an owner for violation of any of the provisions of this chapter within any twelve-month period, in addition to or in lieu of a further notice of a water waste charge the city manager may, in the city manager's discretion:\n(1)\tCut Off Water: Suspend water service to the premises for a period of time not to exceed thirty days after giving notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with Chapter 3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981.

All other utility customers are \"nonresidential,\" including, without limitation, business, commercial, industrial and institutional connections and recreational facilities appurtenant to residential developments.\n(c)\tCombined Uses: Developments with combined residential and nonresidential uses in the same structure shall pay a plant investment fee based on the individual uses within the structure. The \"nonresidential\" portion of the developments shall be assessed in accordance with the \"nonresidential\" fee schedule. The residential portion shall be assessed in accordance with the residential fee schedule.\n(d)\tLandscape Irrigation Systems: All utility customers (except owners of single unit dwellings and townhouse units) who desire to install landscape irrigation systems, including the developer of a townhouse complex or an association of townhouse owners desiring to install a landscape irrigation system on a portion of the commonly owned land, shall install a separate meter and pay a water plant investment fee based on the schedule of fees.\n(e)\tInformation Required: All applicants shall provide all pertinent information that the city manager may require to determine the plant investment fee, including, without limitation, a set of plans certifying the number and type of plumbing fixtures and the maximum design and demand in gallons per minute of any desired landscape irrigation system, along with the area of said irrigated land.\n(f)\tChanges to Water Use: No customer of the water utility or a water district obtaining service under contract with the city shall make any changes or additions to the property that would affect the use of water without first obtaining permission to make such changes and a new permit for the use of the water under section 11-1-14, \"Permit to Make Water Main Connections,\" B.R.C. 1981, and paying the plant investment fee. The city manager shall credit such user an amount equal to the plant investment fee that would have been charged before the change or addition, but if the credit is less than the amount previously paid for a water plant investment fee, the amount paid shall be allowed as a credit. The credit shall be based upon documented historic water use data or other available, relevant data. But no credit shall be allowed for a plant investment fee collected from out-of-city customers that exceeds that charged to in-city customers. No refund shall be paid to any water user who obtains permission to decrease the demand for service. No cash refunds shall be paid for allowable credit exceeding the new plant investment fee. The credit prescribed by this subsection applies to only the property served by the existing water service line and to only water plant investment fees owed to the city and not to other utility fees or charges. Credit will not be allowed for service line stubs or for services not in use for a continuous period of five years or more. Prior to the expiration of the five years, the applicant may request an extension of time to receive a credit for water plant investment fees owed to the city. The city manager may grant such extensions based on a showing of good cause by the applicant.\n(g)\tCollection of Fee: The city may look only to the owner and the owner's successors in interest of each premises, building, lot, house or dwelling unit desiring water service for the payment of the assessed water plant investment fee.\n(h)\tProcessing of Requests: All building permit applications and other requests for water service received by the water utility will be processed in compliance with the plant investment fee schedule prescribed by section 4-20-26, \"Water Plant Investment Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981 in effect as of the date of submission.\n(i)\tAccess to Premises: The city manager may have access at reasonable times to all premises of water utility users for purposes of counting and verifying existence of fixtures to determine plant investment fees.\n(j)\tSpecial Agreements and Contracts: Any applicant desiring to use water from the water utility, if such water use demand is greater than the water use demand anticipated for the property and use, based on land use zoning and approved utility master planning, shall enter into a special agreement with the city and shall pay a water plant investment fee pursuant to section 4-20-26, \"Water Plant Investment Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981. Such special agreement shall contain the legal description of the property, the use to be served and a description of the instantaneous peak, daily peak and annual water demand for the property and use, a description of the water use demand as anticipated by the city and terms of the PIF payment. In addition, such special agreement may also contain financing, connection and monitoring provisions to accommodate equitably the needs of the user, and no statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting such provisions. A copy of each proposed special agreement shall be placed on a city council agenda prior to execution, so that the council has an opportunity to call the agreement up for council review.\nOrdinance Nos. 5075 (1987); 5106 (1988); 5499 (1992); 5526 (1992); 5760 (1995); 5769 (1996); 5845 (1996); 6093 (1999); 7478 (2006); 7643 (2009); 8140 (2016)"

Such bonds or other obligations shall be authorized by ordinance, adopted by the city council in the same manner as other ordinances of the City. Such bonds or other obligations may be issued without voter approval provided that, during the fiscal year of the City preceding the year in which the bonds or other obligations are authorized, the stormwater and flood management utility enterprise received under ten percent of its annual revenue in grants or, during the current fiscal year of the City, it is reasonably anticipated that such enterprise will receive under ten percent of its revenue in grants. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to require voter approval where such approval is not otherwise required by the constitution and laws of the state or the charter of the City, including, without limitation, refunding bonds.\n(b)\tThe terms, conditions and details of said bonds or other obligations, and the procedures related thereto, shall be set forth in the ordinance authorizing said bonds or other obligations and shall, as nearly as may be practicable, be substantially the same as those provided in part 4 of article 35 of title 31, C.R.S., relating to water and sewer revenue bonds; except that the purpose for which the same be issued shall not be so limited, and except that said bonds or other obligations must be sold at public sale in accordance with the provisions of the city charter. Notice of public sale shall comply with the requirements of the City and need not comply with § 31-35-404(2)(c), C.R.S. Each bond, note or other obligation issued under this section shall recite in substance that said bond, note or other obligation, including the interest thereon, is payable from the revenues and other available funds of the stormwater and flood management utility enterprise pledged for the payment thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, such bonds or other obligations may be issued to mature at such times and shall bear interest at such rates as shall be determined by the city council. Refunding bonds of the stormwater and flood management utility enterprise need not comply with § 31-35-412, C.R.S., but shall be issued as provided in part 1 of article 56 of title 11, C.R.S., or any other applicable law. The powers provided in this section to issue bonds or other obligations are in addition and supplemental to, and not in substitution for, the powers conferred by any other law, and the powers provided in this section shall not modify, limit or affect the powers conferred by any other law either directly or indirectly. Bonds, notes or other obligations may be issued pursuant to this section without regard to the provisions of any other law. Insofar as the provisions of this section are inconsistent with the provisions of any other law, the provisions of this section shall control with regard to any bonds lawfully issued pursuant to this section.\n(c)\tAny pledge of revenue or other funds of the stormwater and flood management utility enterprise shall be subject to any limitation on future pledges thereof contained in any ordinance of the governing body of the stormwater and flood management utility enterprise or of the City authorizing the issuance of any outstanding bonds or other obligations of the stormwater and flood management utility enterprise or the City payable from the same source or sources. Bonds or other obligations separately issued by the City and the stormwater and flood management utility enterprise but secured by the same revenues or other funds shall be treated as having the same obligor and as being payable in whole or in part from the same source or sources.\nOrdinance Nos. 5601 (1993); 7400 (2004)"

and\n(F)\tThe applicant shall not be issued a franchise if an elected official of the city holds a controlling interest in the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall provide an opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under subparagraph 11-6-4(b)(3)(D), B.R.C. 1981, by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, the remoteness of the matter from the operation of cable systems, or any other matter relating to the applicant's legal qualifications.\n(4)\tA statement prepared by a certified public accountant regarding the applicant's financial ability to complete the construction and operation of the cable system proposed;\n(5)\tA description of the applicant's prior experience in cable system ownership, construction and operation, and identification of cities and counties in which the applicant has, or has had, a cable franchise or any interest therein, provided that an applicant that holds a franchise for the city and is seeking renewal of that franchise need only provide this information for other cities and counties where its franchise is scheduled to expire in the calendar year prior to or after its application is submitted to the city;\n(6)\tIdentification of the area of the city to be served by the proposed cable system, including a description of the proposed franchise area's boundaries;\n(7)\tA detailed description of the physical facilities proposed, including channel capacity, technical design, performance characteristics, headend and access facilities;\n(8)\tWhere applicable, a description of the construction of the proposed cable system, including an estimate of plant mileage and its location; the proposed construction schedule; a description, where appropriate, of how services will be converted from existing facilities to new facilities; and information on the availability of space in conduits including, where appropriate, an estimate of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing facilities;\n(9)\tIf and to the extent that rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the city under applicable law, the proposed rate structure, including projected charges for each service tier, installation, converters and all other proposed equipment or services;\n(10)\tA demonstration of how the applicant will reasonably meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, including descriptions of the channels, facilities and support for public, educational and governmental use of the cable system (including institutional networks) that the applicant proposes to provide and why the applicant believes that the proposal is adequate to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the costs thereof and the potential for amortization of such costs;\n(11)\tPro forma financial projections for the proposed franchise term, including a statement of projected income, and a schedule of planned capital additions, with all significant assumptions explained in notes or supporting schedules;\n(12)\tIf the applicant proposes to provide cable service to a television shadow area, an agreement to comply with paragraph 11-6-5(f)(6), B.R.C. 1981;\n(13)\tAny other information as may be reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this chapter;\n(14)\tAn affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, acknowledging the enforceability of application commitments, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law.\n(c)\tApplication for Grant of a Franchise, Other Than a Cable Act Renewal Franchise:\n(1)\tA person may apply for a franchise by submitting a request for issuance of a Request for Proposals (\"RFP\") and requesting an evaluation of its application pursuant to paragraph 11-6-4(c)(3), B.R.C. 1981. Upon receipt of a request for an RFP, the city shall, if necessary, commence a proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests of the community and, upon completion of that proceeding, shall promptly issue an RFP and proposed franchise agreement, which shall be mailed to the person requesting its issuance and any existing cable system franchisee and made available to any other interested party. The applicant shall respond within the time directed by the city, providing the information and material set forth in subsection 11-6-4(b), B.R.C. 1981. The procedures, instructions and requirements set forth in the RFP shall be followed by each applicant as if set forth and required herein. The city or its designee may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information. An existing franchisee shall have the right to file comments regarding any applicant and any application, which shall be treated as part of the record before the city.\n(2)\tNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 11-6-4(c)(1), B.R.C. 1981, a person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application containing the information required in subsection 11-6-4(b), B.R.C. 1981, and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to paragraph 11-6-4(c)(3), B.R.C. 1981. Prior to evaluating that application, the city may conduct such investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the standards set forth in paragraph 11-6-4(c)(3), B.R.C. 1981, and may seek additional applications.\n(3)\tIn evaluating an application for a franchise, the city shall consider, among other things, the following factors:\n(A)\tThe extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise for the city;\n(B)\tWhether the quality of the applicant's service under any existing franchise in the city, including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices and the like, has been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served;\n(C)\tWhether the applicant has the financial, technical and legal qualifications to hold a cable franchise;\n(D)\tWhether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the city and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests;\n(E)\tWhether, to the extent not considered as part of subparagraph 11-6-4(c)(3)(D), B.R.C. 1981, the applicant will provide adequate PEG use, capacity, facilities and financial support;\n(F)\tWhether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and private property that would be used by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services or use of the public rights-of-way; the effect of granting an overbuild franchise on the ability of any existing franchisee to meet the cable-related needs and interests of the community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications; and\n(G)\tWhether the approval of the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city.\n(4)\tIf the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors set forth above, and subject to the applicant's negotiation of and agreement on an appropriate franchise agreement, it shall schedule a public vote on a proposed franchise. If the city denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the city may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received. The city also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP.\n(d)\tApplication for Grant of a Cable Act Renewal Franchise: Applications for renewal under the Cable Act shall be received and reviewed in a manner consistent with section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546. It is the proposal submitted by a franchisee under 47 U.S.C. § 546(b), and not the request for commencement of the renewal proceedings submitted under 47 U.S.C. § 546(a), that must contain the information required under subsection 11-6-4(b), B.R.C. 1981. If neither a franchisee nor the city activates a renewal application in a timely manner, or can activate the renewal process as set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-(g) (including, for example, if the provisions are repealed), and except as to applications submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(h), the provisions of subsection 11-6-4(c), B.R.C. 1981, shall apply, and a renewal request shall be evaluated using the same criteria as any other request for a franchise. The following requirements shall apply to renewal requests properly submitted pursuant to the Cable Act:\n(1)\tIf the provisions of 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-(g) are properly invoked, the city shall issue an RFP after conducting a proceeding to review the applicant's past performance and to identify future cable-related community needs and interests. The city shall promptly make available for review by the applicant the results of its review and ascertainment process. The city manager or the manager's designee shall establish deadlines and procedures for responding to the RFP, which deadlines may not be less than one hundred twenty days after the date of the RFP, may seek additional information from the applicant related to the city's evaluation of the proposal under applicable law, and shall establish deadlines for the submission of that additional information. Following receipt of the application responding to that RFP (and such additional information as may be provided in response to requests), the city council will determine that the franchise should be renewed, or make a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed. This determination shall be in accordance with the time limits established by the Cable Act. The preliminary determination shall be made by resolution. If the city council determines that the franchise should not be renewed, and the applicant that submitted the renewal application notifies the city, either in its RFP response or within thirty working days of the preliminary assessment, that it wishes to pursue any rights to an administrative proceeding it has under the Cable Act, then the city shall commence an administrative proceeding after providing prompt public notice thereof, in accordance with the Cable Act. If the city council decides preliminarily to grant renewal, it shall prepare a final franchise agreement that incorporates, as appropriate, the commitments made by the applicant in the renewal application. If the applicant accepts the franchise agreement, and the final agreement is ratified by the city council, the franchise shall be renewed. If the franchise agreement is not so accepted and ratified within the time limits established by 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1), renewal shall be deemed preliminarily denied, and an administrative proceeding commenced if the applicant that submitted the renewal application requests it within thirty business days of the expiration of the time limit established by 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1), unless the time limit is extended by mutual agreement of the city and the franchisee.\n(2)\tIf an administrative hearing is commenced pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(c), the applicant's renewal application shall be evaluated considering such matters as may be considered consistent with federal law. The following procedures shall apply:\n(A)\tThe city council shall, by resolution, appoint an administrative hearing officer or officers (referred to hereafter as \"hearing officer\"). The city council may appoint itself as hearing officer.\n(B)\tThe hearing officer may conduct a pre-hearing conference and establish appropriate pre-hearing orders. Intervention by non-parties is not authorized except to the extent required by the Cable Act.\n(C)\tThe hearing officer shall require the city and the applicant to submit prepared testimony prior to the hearing. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the applicant shall present evidence first, and the city shall present evidence second.\n(D)\tAny reports or the transcript or summary of any proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(a) shall be, for purposes of the administrative hearing, regarded no differently than any other evidence.\n(E)\tThe city and the franchisee shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation in the proceeding, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)), to require the production of evidence and to question witnesses.\n(F)\tFollowing completion of any hearing, the hearing officer shall require the parties to submit proposed findings of fact with respect to the matters that the city is entitled to consider in determining whether renewal ought to be granted. Based on the record of the hearing, the hearing officer shall then prepare written findings with respect to those matters, and submit those findings and conclusions and related conclusions of law to the city council and to the parties (unless the hearing officer is the city council, in which case the written findings shall constitute the final decision of the city).\n(G)\tIf the hearing officer is not the city council, the parties shall have thirty days from the date the findings are submitted to the city council to file exceptions to those findings with the city council. The city council shall thereafter issue a written decision granting or denying the application for renewal, consistent with the requirements of the Cable Act and based on the record of such proceeding. A copy of the final decision of the city council will be promptly provided to the applicant.\n(H)\tThe proceeding shall be conducted with all deliberate speed.\n(I)\tIn conducting the proceedings, and except as inconsistent with the foregoing, the hearing officer will follow the procedures as set forth in chapter 1-3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981, or the successor ordinances thereto. The hearing officer or the parties may request that the city council adopt additional procedures and requirements as necessary in the interest of justice.\n(J)\tThis section does not prohibit any franchisee from submitting an informal renewal application pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(h), which application may be granted or denied in accordance with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. § 546(h). If such an informal renewal application is granted, then the steps specified in this section need not be taken, notwithstanding the provisions thereof.\n(e)\tApplication for Modification of a Franchise:\n(1)\tAn application for modification of a franchise agreement shall include, at minimum, the following information:\n(A)\tThe specific modification requested;\n(B)\tThe justification for the requested modification, including the impact of the requested modification on subscribers and others, and the financial impact on the applicant if the modification is approved or disapproved, demonstrated through, inter alia, submission of pro forma financial statements.\n(C)\tA statement indicating whether the modification is sought pursuant to section 625 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 545, and, if so, a demonstration that the requested modification meets the standards set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 545;\n(D)\tAny other information that the applicant believes is necessary for the city to make an informed determination on the application for modification; and\n(E)\tAn affidavit or declaration of the applicant or applicant's authorized officer certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application is consistent with the requirements of applicable law.\n(2)\tA request for modification submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545 shall be considered in accordance with the requirements of that section.\n(f)\tFiling Fees: To be acceptable for filing, an application submitted after the effective date of this chapter shall be accompanied by a reasonable filing fee in an amount sufficient to cover reasonable costs incidental to the awarding or enforcement of the franchise. Such costs shall be established by resolution of the city council, subject to applicable law.\n(g)\tPublic Hearings: An applicant shall be notified of any public hearings held in connection with the evaluation of its application and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. In addition, prior to the issuance of a franchise, the city shall provide for the holding of a public hearing within the proposed franchise area, following reasonable notice to the public, at which each applicant and its application shall be examined and the public and all interested parties afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Reasonable notice to the public shall include causing notice of the time and place of such hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed franchise area once a week for two consecutive weeks. The first publication shall be not less than fourteen days before the day of the hearing.\n(h)\tConsistency With Cable Act: The provisions of this section shall be read and applied so that they are consistent with section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546."

The schedule shall provide for prompt completion of the project, considering the amount and type of construction required.\n(b)\tConstruction Procedures:\n(1)\tA franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain a cable system subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the city who have jurisdiction in such matters and in strict compliance with all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations affecting the cable system.\n(2)\tThe cable system shall be subject to the right of periodic inspection by the city. Inspections will be conducted in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the operations of a cable system or the provision of service to subscribers. The city will bear its own costs associated with any independent technical tests of the cable system.\n(3)\tNo construction, reconstruction or relocation of the cable system within the public rights-of-way shall be commenced until written permits have been obtained from the proper city officials. In any permit so issued, such officials may impose such fees, conditions and regulations as a condition of the granting of the permit as are imposed on similar uses of the right-of-way.\n(c)\tConstruction Standards:\n(1)\tThe construction, operation, maintenance or repair of a cable system shall be in accordance with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, zoning laws, construction codes and the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards, as amended. A franchisee shall at all times employ reasonable care, within the meaning of applicable law, and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the public.\n(2)\tWithout limiting the foregoing, all of a franchisee's cable system shall be constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by experienced and properly trained maintenance and construction personnel.\n(3)\tExcept in underground service areas, all parts of the cable system, including electronics, vaults, trunk, feeder and drop cable may be constructed overhead where poles now exist and electric and telephone lines are now overhead, but where either electric or telephone lines are underground, all trunk, feeder and drop cable shall be constructed underground. Whenever and wherever the poles on which a franchisee's poles are attached are no longer in use for electrical or telephone plant, all cable system facilities and plant attached to such poles shall be moved underground by the franchisee.\n(4)\tAll safety practices required by law shall be used during construction, maintenance and repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall at all times employ reasonable care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the public.\n(5)\tA franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment or fixtures where they will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone, telecommunications, water, sewer or other utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner such entities' use of any public rights-of-way, and no future occupant of the right-of-way shall interfere with the use of the right-of-way by a franchisee.\n(6)\tAny and all public rights-of-way, public property or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance or construction of a cable system shall be promptly repaired by the franchisee.\n(7)\tA franchisee shall, by a time specified by the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove any of its property when required by the city or any other governmental entity by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way maintenance or repair (including resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way grade; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks or any other type of government-owned communications system, public work or improvement or any government-owned utility; public right-of-way vacation; undergrounding of adjacent electric or telephone line so that adjacent poles are no longer in use for electrical or telephone plant; or for any other purpose where the convenience of the city or such entity would be served thereby; provided, however, that:\n(A)\tExcept in the case of emergencies, the city shall provide written notice describing where the work is to be performed at least one week prior to the deadline for performing the work; a franchisee may seek an extension of the time to perform the work where it cannot be performed in a week even with the exercise of due diligence, and such request for an extension shall not be unreasonably refused; and\n(B)\tA franchisee may abandon any property in place upon notice to the city, unless the city determines, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion exercised within sixty days of the date the city receives notice, that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public rights-of-way and facilities in the public rights-of-way will be adversely affected thereby.\n(8)\tIf any removal, relaying or relocation is required to accommodate the construction, operation or repair of the facilities of another person (other than the city) that is authorized to use the public rights-of-way, a franchisee shall, after thirty days' advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested by the responsible entity. Unless the matter is governed by a valid contract or a state or federal law or regulation, the reasonable cost of removal, relaying or relocation shall be borne by the party requesting the removal, relaying or relocation. The city may direct a franchisee to remove, relay or relocate its facilities pending resolution of a dispute as to responsibility for costs, if the person requesting removal, relaying or relocation posts security satisfactory to the city.\n(9)\tIn the event of an emergency, or where a cable system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property, while the officers of the city will make reasonable efforts to contact the franchisee, the city may remove, relay or relocate any or all parts of that cable system without prior notice.\n(10)\tA franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or other structures. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting same, and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The franchisee shall be given not less than fourteen days' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.\n(11)\tSubject to obtaining advance permission from the city manager, which shall not be unreasonably refused, a franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang a public right-of-way of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires of the franchisee. At the option of the city, such trimming may be done by it or by the franchisee, but in either case, at the expense of the franchisee.\n(12)\tPrior to erection of any towers, poles or conduits or the construction, upgrade or rebuild of a cable system authorized under this chapter, a franchisee shall first submit to the city and other designated parties for approval a concise description of the cable system proposed to be erected or installed, including engineering drawings, if required by the city, together with a map and plans indicating the proposed location of all such facilities. No erection or installation of any tower, pole, underground conduit or fixture or any rebuilding or upgrading of a cable system shall be commenced by any person until approval therefor has been received from the city in accordance with standard permitting practices of the city. A franchisee is expected to use, with the owner's permission, existing underground conduits or overhead utility facilities whenever feasible.\n(13)\tAny contractor or subcontractor used for work or construction, installation, operation, maintenance or repair of cable system equipment must be properly licensed, and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same obligations with respect to its work as franchisee would have under this chapter and applicable law if the work were performed by the franchisee. The franchisee must ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all employees who will perform work for it are trained and experienced. The franchisee shall be responsible for ensuring that the work of contractors and subcontractors is performed consistent with its franchise agreement and applicable law, shall be fully responsible for all acts or omissions of contractors or subcontractors, shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by any contractor or subcontractor, and shall implement a quality control program to ensure that the work is properly performed. This subsection shall not be deemed to alter a franchisee's tort liability to third parties.\n(d)\tParticipation With Other Utilities and the City: A franchisee shall cooperate in the planning, locating and construction of its cable system in utility joint trenches or common duct banks with other telecommunications providers and the city. The city will provide advance notice to any franchisee when it plans to open a trench and each franchisee shall provide notice to the city when it plans to open a trench. The franchisee and the city will offer to make space available to the other, and to other persons who are subject to the same obligations, on reasonable terms, consistent with applicable law and this chapter.\n(e)\tUnderground Services Alert: Each franchisee shall be a member of the regional notification center for subsurface installations (underground services alert) and shall field mark, at its sole cost and expense, the locations of its underground cable system facilities upon notification by the city.\n(f)\tProvision of Service/Quality of Service: In addition to satisfying such requirements as may be established through the application process, every cable system shall be subject to the following conditions, except as prohibited by federal law or where other standards are specified in a franchise agreement:\n(1)\tAfter cable service has been established by activating trunk distribution cable for an area specified in a franchise agreement, a franchisee shall provide cable service to any household or commercial establishment requesting cable service in accordance with the franchise agreement within that area, including each attached dwelling unit in that area, except for attached dwelling units to which it cannot legally obtain access. Service must be provided within time limits specified in paragraph 11-6-5(f)(2), B.R.C. 1981.\n(2)\tA franchisee must extend service to any person who requests it within ten days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop, within ninety days where an extension of one-half a mile or less is required, and within six months when an extension of more than one-half mile is required, provided that, in cases where a franchise agreement permits a franchisee to require a potential subscriber to bear a share of extension or installation costs, and franchisee requires the potential subscriber to bear such costs, the time for extension shall be measured from the date on which the subscriber agrees to bear such costs or, if a franchisee requires prepayment of all or a portion of the estimated costs, from the date on which the prepayment is made. A franchisee that requires a potential subscriber to bear a portion of installation or extension costs must prepare a written estimate of extension costs within seven days of a request for an installation or extension that would be subject to cost-sharing.\n(3)\tAny cable system within the city shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 76.601 and any other applicable technical standards. Enforcement of such technical standards shall be by the FCC unless the FCC allows enforcement by the city.\n(4)\tA franchisee shall perform all tests reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the franchise agreement and other performance standards established by applicable law. Unless a franchise agreement or applicable law provides otherwise, all tests shall be conducted in accordance with federal rules and in accordance with the most recent edition of National Cable Television Association's Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television Systems, or if no recent edition exists, such other appropriate manual as the city may designate. A written report of any test results shall be filed with the city within seven days of each test. If the location fails to meet performance specifications, within a reasonable time the franchisee, without requirement of additional notice or request from city, shall take corrective action, retest the locations and advise the city of the action taken and results achieved.\n(5)\tThe city may conduct inspections of a cable system including, without limitation, the headend, construction areas and subscriber installations to assess, among other things, franchisee's compliance with its franchise agreement and applicable law. If the franchisee is notified of any violations found during course of inspections, the franchisee must bring violations into compliance within thirty days of the date on which notice of violation is given, and must submit a report to the city describing the steps taken to bring itself into compliance or must file an appeal with the city manager during the same time period. All appeals shall be decided under chapter 1-3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981. Inspection does not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to build a cable system in compliance with all provisions of its franchise agreement and applicable law.\n(6)\tAny franchise serving any portion of the city must accept equivalent obligations for franchise fees and PEG use, capacity, facilities and financial support, on a gross revenue or per subscriber basis, as the case may be.\n(7)\tIf a franchise serves a television shadow area, it must construct at least an equivalent number of miles of cable distribution plant outside of the television shadow area as it constructs inside the television shadow area and must satisfy the other obligations imposed on any other franchise or permit, other than those relating to geographical coverage, and must accept equivalent obligations for franchise fees and PEG use, capacity, facilities and financial support, on a gross revenue or per subscriber basis, as the case may be.\n(g)\tPublicizing Proposed Construction Work: A franchisee shall publicize any substantial rebuild of its cable system at least one week prior to commencement of that work by causing written notice of such construction work to be delivered to the city and by notifying those persons within three hundred feet of the work in at least two of the following ways: by telephone, in person, by mail, by distribution of flyers to residences, by publication in local newspapers or in any other manner reasonably calculated to provide adequate notice. In addition, before entering onto any person's property, a franchisee shall attempt to contact the property owner or (in the case of residential property) the resident at least one day in advance. If a franchisee must enter a residence or building, it must schedule an appointment at the convenience of the owner or resident.\n(h)\tSystem Maintenance:\n(1)\tA franchisee shall schedule maintenance so that activities likely to result in an interruption of service are performed during periods of minimum subscriber use of the cable system.\n(2)\tEach franchise agreement shall provide that the franchisee will be obligated to follow maintenance practices that will ensure that its cable system is maintained in accordance with the highest industry standards.\n(i)\tContinuity of Service: Each franchise agreement shall provide that subscribers are able to receive continuous service and that, in the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee shall be obligated to continue to provide service for a reasonable period to assure an orderly transition of service from the franchisee to another entity."

For purposes of this chapter, the terms \"books and records\" shall be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored.\n(2)\tAccess to a franchisee's books and records shall not be denied by a franchisee on the basis that said books and records contain proprietary information. However, all proprietary information received by the city from a franchisee and clearly marked as such shall not be publicly disclosed insofar as permitted or required to be withheld by the Colorado Public Records Act, § 24-72-204, C.R.S., and other applicable law. The city will notify franchisee if any third party seeks release of any document marked confidential, and the city will withhold release for the maximum period permitted by law to provide the franchisee the opportunity to seek court protection against the release of the requested documents.\n(3)\tThe franchisee shall maintain a file of records open to public inspection in accordance with applicable FCC rules and regulations.\n(b)\tCommunication With Regulatory Agencies: Upon request, a franchisee shall file with the city all non-confidential reports required by the FCC including, without limitation, any proof of performance tests and results and all petitions, applications and communications of all types regarding the cable system submitted or received by the franchisee, an affiliate or any other person on the behalf of the franchisee, either to or from the FCC, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over any matter affecting operation of the franchisee's cable system. Provided that, nothing herein requires the franchisee to produce regulatory or court filings that are treated by the agency or court as confidential, such as Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filings. Nothing in this subsection affects any rights the city may have to obtain books and records under paragraph 11-6-6(a)(1), B.R.C. 1981. Franchisee shall also deliver to the city copies of any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the franchisee or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the franchise directly or indirectly.

The results of the survey must be submitted by August 31 of the calendar year for which the survey is being conducted.\n(3)\tFranchisees shall deliver the following special reports:\n(A)\tEach franchisee shall submit monthly construction reports for its cable system to the city after the franchise is awarded for any construction undertaken during the term of the franchise until such construction is complete, including any rebuild that may be specified in the franchise agreement. A franchisee must submit updated as-built system design maps to the city within thirty days of the completion of system construction in any geographic area, without notation of electronic components. The city shall protect confidential commercial data from disclosure under the Colorado Public Records Act, § 24-72-204, C.R.S. The maps shall be developed on the basis of post-construction inspection by the franchisee and construction personnel to assess compliance with system design. Any departures from design must be indicated on the as-built maps, to assist the city in assessing operator compliance with its obligations under the franchise agreement. As-built maps shall also be supplied to the city in electronic form, compatible with city GIS and other data systems.\n(B)\tA report submitted within thirty days of the end of each calendar quarter showing the number of service calls received by type during the prior quarter, and the percentage of service calls compared to the subscriber base by type of complaint.\n(d)\tRecords Required: A franchisee shall maintain for a period of at least six months:\n(1)\tRecords of complaints received in the form maintained as of the effective date of a franchise.

If, as a result of the audit, the city determines that the franchisee has underpaid the franchise fees owed in an amount exceeding five percent of the franchise fees actually paid, the reasonable cost of the audit, up to $10,000.00, shall be borne by the person responsible to pay the fee. The audit shall be performed in the city, and it shall be the responsibility of the person subject to the fee to have all books and records necessary to satisfactorily perform the audit readily available to the auditors.\n(i)\tFailure to Pay Franchise Fee: In the event that a franchise fee payment is not received by the city on or before the due date set forth in subsection 11-6-10(b), B.R.C. 1981, or is underpaid, the person subject to the fee shall pay interest from the due date at an interest rate equal to three percent above the rate for three-month federal Treasury Bills at the most recent United States Treasury Department sale of such Treasury Bills occurring prior to the due date of the franchise fee payment.\n(j)\tFinal Statement of Gross Revenues: When a franchise terminates for whatever reason, the franchisee shall file with the city within ninety calendar days of the date its operations in the city cease a financial statement, certified by a certified public accountant or the franchisee's chief financial officer, showing the gross revenues received by the franchisee since the end of the previous fiscal year.

The amount of the security fund shall be equal to three percent of the franchisee's projected annual average gross revenues or $100,000.00, whichever is less, unless modified by the franchise agreement.\n(2)\tIn lieu of a cash security fund, a franchisee may file and maintain with the city an irrevocable letter of credit with an acceptable surety in the amount specified in the preceding paragraph to serve the same purposes as set forth therein. Said letter of credit shall remain in effect for the full term of the franchise plus an additional six months thereafter. The letter of credit shall secure the franchisee's faithful performance and compliance with all provisions of this chapter, the franchise agreement and other applicable law, and to comply with all orders, permits and directions of the city, and payment of any claims, liens, fees or taxes due the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system. The letter of credit shall provide for thirty days' prior written notice to the city of any intention on the part of the franchisee to fail to renew or otherwise materially alter its terms.

Failure to make timely delivery of such amount to the city or to restore the letter of credit shall constitute a material violation of the franchise.\n(E)\tUpon termination of the franchise, the balance then remaining in the security fund, if any, shall be withdrawn by the city and paid to the franchisee within ninety days of such termination, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the franchisee, in which case the amount paid may be reduced by the amount of the outstanding default; provided that, the security fund or letter of credit shall be deemed forfeited if the franchise is revoked or the cable system is abandoned.\n(b)\tSecurity Fund or Letter of Credit Constitutes Material Term: The security fund or letter of credit set forth in this section shall constitute a material term of a franchise.\n(c)\tRemedies: In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, the city may apply any one or a combination of the following remedies in the event a franchisee violates this chapter, its franchise agreement or applicable law:\n(1)\tRevoke the franchise pursuant to the procedures specified in this chapter.\n(2)\tImpose penalties available under subsection 11-6-12(e), B.R.C. 1981, and other applicable state and local laws for violation of city ordinances.\n(3)\tIn addition to or instead of any other remedy, seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.\n(4)\tApply any remedy provided for in a franchise agreement, including enforcement provisions, if any.\n(d)\tRevocation or Termination of Franchise:\n(1)\tA franchise may be revoked by the city council for the franchisee's failure to construct, operate or maintain the cable system as required by this chapter or the franchise agreement, or for any other material violation of this chapter or material breach of the franchise agreement. If within sixty calendar days following written notice from the city to the franchisee that it is in material violation of this chapter or in material breach of the franchise agreement, the franchisee has not, to the city's satisfaction, taken corrective action or corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to consider revocation of the franchise, stating its reasons.\n(2)\tPrior to revoking a franchise, the city council shall hold a public hearing, upon at least thirty calendar days' notice, at which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following the public hearing the city council may determine whether to revoke the franchise based on the evidence presented at the hearing, and other evidence of record. If the city council determines to revoke a franchise, it shall issue a written decision setting forth the reasons for its decision. A copy of such decision shall be transmitted to the franchisee.\n(3)\tTo the extent permissible under federal law, any franchise may, at the option of the city following a public hearing before the city council, be revoked one hundred twenty calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that one-hundred-twenty-day period:\n(A)\tSuch assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated.\n(B)\tSuch assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement.\n(e)\tForeclosure: In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee used for the franchise, the city may revoke or shorten the franchise, following a public hearing before the city council, by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate thirty calendar days after serving such notice, unless:\n(1)\tThe city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and\n(2)\tThe successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and this chapter.\n(f)\tProcedures Upon Revocation or Abandonment of a Franchise: If the city revokes a franchise, or if, for any other reason, a franchisee abandons or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers as required by its franchise, the following procedures and rights are effective:\n(1)\tThe city may require the former franchisee to remove its aerial facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former franchisee's expense and may use the permit fund or letter of credit to reimburse itself for such expense;\n(2)\tThe city, by resolution of the city council, may acquire ownership or effect a transfer of the cable system at fair market value, with no value assigned to the franchise itself, and with the price adjusted downward for the harm to the city or subscribers, if any, resulting from the franchisee's breach of its franchise agreement or violation of this section and further adjusted to account for other equitable factors that may be considered consistent with 47 U.S.C. § 547; or\n(3)\tIf a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the city may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the cable system.\n(4)\tThe provisions herein shall be subject to and be interpreted so that they are consistent with any provisions in a franchise agreement designed to ensure continuity of service in the event a franchise is revoked or terminated, or the cable system is abandoned."

At a minimum, the following information must be included in the application:\n(A)\tAll information and forms required under federal law;\n(B)\tAll information required in paragraphs 11-6-4(b)(5), (b)(11) and (b)(14), B.R.C. 1981;\n(C)\tA detailed statement of the corporate or other business entity organization of the proposed transferee, together with an explanation of how decisions regarding the cable system will be made if the proposed transaction is approved;\n(D)\tAny contracts, financing documents or other documents that relate to the proposed transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits or the like referred to therein, if and to the extent that such documents exist at the time of filing, subject to a requirement of ongoing supplementation through the application process;\n(E)\tAny publicly available shareholder reports or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Trade Commission that discuss the transaction;\n(F)\tComplete financial statements for any potential transferees for the last three years, including balance sheets, income statements, profit and loss statements and documents detailing capital investments and operating costs;\n(G)\tTo the extent known, a detailed description of the sources and amounts of the funds to be used in the proposed transaction, indicating how the debt-equity ratio of the cable system will change in the course of the transaction; what entities will be liable for repayment of any debt incurred; what interest, payment schedule and other terms or conditions will apply to any debt financing; any debt coverages or financial ratios any potential transferees will be required to maintain over the franchise term if the proposed transaction is approved; what financial resources would be available to the cable system under the control of the proposed transferee; whether the proposed transferee can meet debt-equity or any other required ratios without increasing rates, with any assumptions underlying that conclusion, and if not, what increases would be required and why;\n(H)\tAny other information necessary to provide a complete and accurate understanding of the financial position of the cable system before and after the proposed transfer;\n(I)\tComplete information regarding any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service;\n(J)\tAny representations made in writing in connection with the transaction, about the franchisee's compliance with its franchise; and\n(K)\tA brief summary of the proposed transferee's plans for at least the next five years regarding line extension, plant and equipment upgrades, channel capacity, expansion or elimination of services, and any other changes affecting or enhancing the performance of the cable system.\n(3)\tFor the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer, the city or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of the prospective transferee and such other matters as the city may deem necessary to determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be approved, denied, or conditioned under Subsection 11-6-14(c), B.R.C. 1981. The franchisee and any prospective transferees shall assist the city in any such inquiry, and, if they fail to do so, the request for transfer may be denied.\n(c)\tDetermination by City:\n(1)\tIn making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions, an application for a transfer of a franchise, the city shall consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system; any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates or services; whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city; and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers, the city's interest under this chapter, the franchise agreement, other applicable law, or the public interest, or make it less likely that the future cable-related needs and interests of the community would be satisfied at a reasonable cost. The city may deny an application for transfer on the basis of any of these considerations.\n(2)\tAny transfer without the city's prior written approval shall be ineffective and shall make this franchise subject to revocation, at the city's sole discretion, and to any other remedies available under the franchise or other applicable law.\n(3)\tAny mortgage, pledge, or lease shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the city under this chapter or other applicable law.\n(d)\tTransferee's Agreement: No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee under this chapter and the franchise agreement for all purposes, including renewal, unless the city, in its sole discretion, expressly waives this requirement in whole or in part.\n(e)\tApproval Does Not Constitute Waiver: Approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this chapter or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer."
