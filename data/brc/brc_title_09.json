Section Heading.\n(a)\tSubsection Heading, with text in the paragraph appearing as hanging indent for the entire Title as shown in this paragraph.\n(1)\tParagraph Heading, with text in the paragraph appearing as hanging indent for the entire Title as shown in this paragraph.\n(A)\tSubparagraph Heading, with text in the paragraph appearing as hanging indent for the entire Title as shown in this paragraph.\nWhen necessary, the numbering system continues beyond the subparagraph heading following a similar pattern of numbering and indentation. Each section includes all material between two section headings. For example, Section 9-1-1 includes all material beginning with the number 9-1-1 up to number 9-1-2. References to any division of this title include all material located within the referenced section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, etc.\n(b)\tZoning Map: Zoning districts are the primary tool for regulating land in Boulder. Prior to considering developing land, an applicant should refer to the official zoning map to determine which zoning district his/her property is located within. The official zoning map is available at the planning department.\n(c)\tModular Zone System: Zoning districts in Boulder are comprised of standards from three modules: use, form and intensity. Combining elements of the three modules creates a zoning district. The zoning districts are identified in Section 9-5-2, \"Zoning Districts,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(1)\tUse Module: The use module establishes the uses that are permitted, may be approved as a conditional use pursuant to Section 9-2-2, \"Administrative Review Procedures,\" B.R.C. 1981, prohibited, or that may be approved through a use review pursuant to Section 9-2-15, \"Use Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. Conditional uses are reviewed through an administrative (staff) review process to ensure conformance with specific use standards. If the use requires a use review, then the project will be required to complete a discretionary review to ensure that any impacts of the use on the surrounding area are minimized. Finally, if the use is an existing legal use that is no longer allowed in the zoning district, and there is a proposal to change or modify the use, it may also be required to complete a use review.\n(2)\tForm Module: The form module establishes the physical parameters for development such as setbacks, building coverage, height and special building design characteristics. Solar access standards, located in Section 9-9-17, \"Solar Access,\" B.R.C. 1981, may also impact building form and should be reviewed in conjunction with the form standards. On parcels and lots designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" the regulations of Chapter 9-14, \"Form-Based Code,\" apply.\n(3)\tIntensity Module: The intensity module establishes the density at which development may occur and includes: minimum lot sizes, minimum open space per dwelling unit, number of dwelling units per acre, minimum open space per lot or parcel, and floor area ratios when applicable. On parcels and lots designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" the regulations of Chapter 9-14, \"Form-Based Code,\" apply.\n(4)\tForm-Based Code Review: The requirements for the form-based code review process are found in Section 9-2-16, \"Form-Based Code Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. Parcels and lots designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" may be subject to the requirements of Chapter 9-14, \"Form-Based Code,\" and may be required to complete a form-based code review. Projects on lots or parcels designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" and eligible for a site review process may complete a site review or form-based code review. Projects required to complete or completing a form-based code review, are not eligible for the variance process.\n(d)\tOverlay Districts and Development Standards: In addition to the zoning district standards, there are additional sets of standards that may be applicable to a property, depending on its location. The applicant should check with the planning department to find out if the property is subject to such regulations, based on the official maps available from the department. First, the applicant should determine if the property is located within a floodplain. Standards regulating lands in the floodplain are found in Sections 9-3-2 through 9-3-8, B.R.C. 1981. If the property is located near the airport, the applicant should determine if the property is located within the airport influence overlay zone. Those standards are located in Section 9-3-10, \"Airport Influence Zone,\" B.R.C. 1981. The applicant should also determine if the property contains any significant wetlands. These regulations are found in Section 9-3-9, \"Stream, Wetlands and Water Body Protection,\" B.R.C. 1981. Finally, the applicant should determine if the property is a designated landmark or located in a designated historic district. Standards regulating historic preservation are located in Chapter 9-11, \"Historic Preservation,\" B.R.C. 1981. In all cases, these overlay district standards apply in addition to any standards of the underlying zoning district. For example, the floodplain overlay regulations may limit or prohibit expansion of existing structures on portions of lots located in the floodplain, even though the basic zone standards would allow it. Other types of overlays may supplement the basic zone standards. For example, a property within the airport influence zone may limit uses or building heights beyond what the base zone standards allow.\n(e)\tDevelopment Standards: Chapter 9-9, \"Development Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, includes development standards that apply in addition to the zoning and overlay district standards. These include standards for parking, landscaping, signs, open space, site access, lighting, solar access and other elements of development.\n(f)\tVariances of Standards/Site Review Process/Form-Based Code Review Process:\n(1)\tIf the applicant cannot meet the standards described in Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the applicant should determine whether there are alternative development options or any exceptions to the general rules in the code that may accommodate the project. If the project does not meet standards and other development alternatives are not possible, then there are two basic methods available to attempt to vary the standards: the variance process and the site review process.\n(2)\tThe variance process is generally used for existing development. Bulk and form requirements may be varied if the applicant can demonstrate an unusual physical circumstance or other hardship. The variance requirements are found in Section 9-2-3, \"Variances and Interpretations,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tThe requirements for the site review process are found in Section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. If the project is large enough to meet the minimum thresholds set forth in the code, then the bulk and form requirements and other specified development standards may be modified as part of a unified development proposal through a site review. If the project is smaller than the minimum thresholds standards, it is not eligible for site review. All projects that exceed the maximum site review threshold will be required to complete a site review.\n(g)\tNonconformance Standards: Adoption of land use controls and changes in zoning have created nonconforming uses, nonstandard buildings and nonstandard lots. Chapter 9-10, \"Nonconformance Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, describes the treatment of these nonconformities. In general, the policy of the City is to allow these nonconforming uses and nonstandard buildings to be changed and upgraded without requiring their elimination if the change would not substantially adversely affect the surrounding area and if the change would not increase the degree of nonconformity of the use.\n(h)\tSubdivision of Land: If the applicant would like to subdivide a piece of property or merge a number of different parcels into one parcel, the applicant may need to go through the subdivision process. The purpose of the subdivision process is to ensure that proposed building sites are appropriate for development; to obtain an accurate and permanent record of the separate interests of land that are created by subdivision of land; to apportion the costs of public services and facilities serving the subdivision; to provide assurances to future buyers of land that the subdivider owns the land to be sold; to provide legal and physical access to each lot; and to provide for maintenance of improvements, utilities and amenities. There are a number of divisions of land to which the subdivision regulations do not apply. The applicant should review these exceptions to determine if the project will be required to complete the subdivision process. There is also an abbreviated process for projects that only require elimination of a lot line between two lots within an existing subdivision. The subdivision process is found in Chapter 9-12, \"Subdivision,\" B.R.C. 1981. The exceptions are found in Section 9-12-2, \"Application of Chapter,\" B.R.C. 1981. The minor subdivision process is found in Section 9-12-5, \"Minor Subdivision,\" B.R.C. 1981. The abbreviated process for lot line eliminations, lot line adjustments and minor subdivisions is found in Section 9-12-4, \"Elimination of Lot Lines,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(i)\tInclusionary Housing: The City has adopted regulations to assist in providing a diverse housing stock affordable to people of varying incomes. Chapter 9-13, \"Inclusionary Housing,\" B.R.C. 1981, sets forth the standards for the City's inclusionary housing and moderate income housing programs. Inclusionary housing requires that most new residential development contribute toward permanent affordable housing in the City. Generally speaking, twenty percent of the total number of units are required to be permanently affordable to low income households.\n(j)\tEnforcement of The Land Use Regulations: Violations of the land use regulation are investigated by the Planning Department and are prosecuted in municipal court, by district court actions or through administrative hearings. A hearing also is available before the Planning Board to protest a violation of a development review approval. The enforcement provisions are found in Chapter 9-15, \"Enforcement,\" B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance Nos. 7658 (2009); 7701 (2010); 8121 (2016); 8337 (2019); 8523 (2022); 8600 (2024); 8669 (2025)"

This step is intended to give the applicant an opportunity to solicit comments from the reviewing authority early in the development process as to whether the concept plan addresses the requirements of the city as set forth in its adopted ordinances, plans, and policies. Comments on a concept plan are not binding, but are meant to inform any subsequent site review application. A concept plan review and comment shall not relieve the applicant of the burden to seek approvals for elements of the plan that require review and approval under the Boulder Revised Code.\n(b)\tProjects Required to Complete Concept Review and Comment: Any applicant for a development that exceeds the \"Site Review Required\" thresholds set forth in Paragraph 9-2-14(b)(1), B.R.C. 1981, shall complete the concept review process prior to submitting an application for site review.\n(c)\tApplication Requirements: A concept plan should be a preliminary plan for the development of a site of sufficient accuracy to be used for discussing the plan's conformance with adopted ordinances, plans, and policies of the city. The concept plan provides the public, the city manager, and the planning board opportunity to offer input in the formative stages of the development. An application for a concept plan review and comment may be filed by a person having a demonstrable property interest in land to be included in a site review on a form provided by the manager and shall include the following:\n(1)\tThe written consent of the owners of all property to be included in the development;\n(2)\tA context map, drawn to scale, showing the site and an area of not less than a 300-foot radius around the site, including streets, zoning, general location of buildings, and parking areas of abutting properties;\n(3)\tA scaled and dimensioned schematic drawing of the site development concept and an area of not less than 200 feet around the site, showing:\n(A)\tAccess points and circulation patterns for all modes of transportation;\n(B)\tApproximate locations of trails, pedestrian and bikeway connections, on-site transit amenities, and parking areas;\n(C)\tApproximate location of major site elements, including buildings, open areas, natural features such as watercourses, wetlands, mature trees, and steep slopes; and\n(D)\tProposed land uses and approximate location;\n(4)\tArchitectural character sketches showing building elevations and materials; and\n(5)\tA written statement that describes, in general, how the proposed development meets this title, city plans and policies, and addresses the following:\n(A)\tTechniques and strategies for environmental impact avoidance, minimization, or mitigation;\n(B)\tTechniques and strategies for practical and economically feasible transportation demand management techniques, including without limitation, site design, land use, covenants, transit passes, parking restrictions, information or education materials, or programs that may reduce single-occupant vehicle trip generation to and from the site; and\n(C)\tProposed land uses and, if it is a development that includes residential housing type, mix, sizes, and anticipated sale prices, the percentage of affordable units to be included; special design characteristics that may be needed to assure affordability.\n(d)\tPublic Notice of Application: After receiving an application, the city manager shall provide public notification pursuant to Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(e)\tAdditional Information or Processes: Based on the concept plan submission, and to the extent that such requirements can be determined from the information provided by the applicant, the city manager will identify additional information or processes that may be needed prior to or concurrent with site review, such as:\n(1)\tVariances and exceptions to existing standards necessary to achieve the defined objectives for the site, and the process and approving agency for the required changes;\n(2)\tProcesses, permits, and approvals that may be needed, including without limitation, wetland permits, floodplain permits, flood map revisions, special large water user or sanitary sewer pretreatment agreements, rezonings, or Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan changes;\n(3)\tNeed for any further environmental studies or impact studies; and\n(4)\tPublic infrastructure improvements needed to serve the development, including without limitation, transportation improvements such as streets, alleys, transit stops, and shelters, other alternative mode facilities and connections, and acceleration and deceleration lanes, water, wastewater, and flood control.\n(f)\tReview of and Comment on Concept Plans: Upon receipt of an application for a concept plan review, the city manager will review the submitted materials for general compliance with the requirements of this title, and prepare staff comments. The scope of staff comments will differ from application to application, at the discretion of the manager. Unless withdrawn, a concept plan shall be referred to the planning board pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this subsection and may be reviewed by the city council pursuant to Paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n(1)\tPlanning Board Review and Comment: The manager will forward the application, any comments received from neighbors and other interested persons, and any staff comments to the planning board. The planning board shall review the concept plan at a public meeting held pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 2-3-1(b), B.R.C. 1981. Planning board members may provide individual comments on the concept plan.\n(2)\tCity Council Call-Up: The city council may call up a concept plan application within thirty days of the board's review. The manager may extend the call-up period until the council's next regular meeting, if the manager finds in writing within the original call-up period that the council will not receive notice of the application in time to enable it to call up the application. Any application that it calls up, the city council will review at a public meeting within sixty days of the call-up vote or within such other time as the manager or council and the applicant mutually agree.\n(g)\tGuidelines for Review and Comment: The following guidelines will be used to guide the planning board's discussion regarding the site.

    "verbatim": "9-2-14. Site Review.\n(a)\tPurpose: The purpose of site review is to allow flexibility in design, to encourage innovation in land use development, to promote the most appropriate use of land, to improve the character and quality of new development, to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities, to preserve the natural and scenic features of open space, to ensure compatible architecture, massing and height of buildings with existing, approved, and known to be planned or projected buildings in the immediate area, to ensure human scale development, to promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians, bicyclists and other modes within and around developments and to implement the goals and policies of the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans of the community. Review criteria are established to achieve the following:\n1.\tConsistency with the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan (BVCP): Development projects are consistent with relevant goals and policies of the BVCP, while recognizing that no project must satisfy one particular goal or policy or all of them.\n2.\tConsistency with Adopted Plans: Development projects are consistent with adopted subcommunity and area plans and design guidelines of the city.\n3.\tSustainability: Projects are designed to be sustainable and address greenhouse gas emissions and to prevent or mitigate impacts to the natural environment.\n4.\tHousing Diversity: Residential projects assist the community in producing a variety of housing types and unit sizes.\n5.\tEnhanced Site Design: Projects preserve and enhance the community's unique sense of place through creative design that respects historic character and the project's relationship to the natural environment, public realm, and surrounding area. The project provides multi-modal transportation connectivity and promotes use of modes other than the single-occupant vehicles. Site open space enhances the pedestrian experience, is functional, and incorporates high-quality sustainable landscaping. Open space meets the needs of the users of the project.\n6.\tEnduring Human Scale Building Design: Buildings exemplify high-quality, enduring architecture with facades that are simple and human scaled. Buildings provide pedestrian interest and are consistent with the character established in adopted subcommunity or area plans or design guidelines or, if none apply, are compatible with the character of the surrounding area or improve upon that character.\n7.\tCommunity Benefit and Enhanced Building and Site Design for Taller, Larger Buildings: Buildings that are built above the by-right zoning district height limits or floor area ratio maximums as may be approved under the standards of this section provide community benefits identified in the BVCP beyond the underlying zoning. These buildings are compatible in form and massing with the surrounding area and preserve and take advantage of prominent views from the site and adjacent public spaces and provide high quality open space that provides relief to the additional height and intensity of the project and the surrounding area.\n(b)\tScope: The following development review thresholds apply to any development that is eligible or that otherwise may be required to complete the site review process:\n(1)\tDevelopment Review Thresholds:\n(A)\tMinimum Thresholds for Voluntary Site Review: No person may apply for a site review application unless the project exceeds the thresholds for the \"minimum size for site review\" category set forth in Table 2-2 of this section or a height modification pursuant to Subparagraph (E) below on any lot is requested.\n(B)\tMinimum Thresholds for Required Site Review: No person may apply for a subdivision or a building permit for a project that exceeds the thresholds for the \"concept plan and site review required\" category set forth in table 2-2 of this section until a site review has been completed.\n(C)\tCommon Ownership: All contiguous lots or parcels under common ownership or control, not subject to a planned development, planned residential development, planned unit development, or site review approval, shall be considered as one property for the purposes of determining whether the maximum site review thresholds below apply. If such lots or parcels cross zoning district boundaries, the lesser threshold of the zoning districts shall apply to all of the lots or parcels.\n(D)\tPreviously Approved Developments: Previously approved valid planned unit developments that do not otherwise meet the minimum site review thresholds may be modified or amended consistent with the provisions of this title pursuant to Subsections (k) and (l) of this section.\n(E)\tHeight Modifications: A development which exceeds the permitted height requirements of Section 9-7-5, \"Building Height,\" or 9-7-6, \"Building Height, Conditional,\" B.R.C. 1981, or of Paragraph 9-10-3(b)(2), \"Maximum Height,\" B.R.C. 1981, to the extent permitted by that paragraph for existing buildings on nonstandard lots, is required to complete a site review and is not subject to the minimum threshold requirements. No standard other than height may be modified under the site review unless the project is also eligible for site review. A development that exceeds the permitted height requirements of Section 9-7-5 or 9-7-6, B.R.C. 1981, must meet any one of the following circumstances in addition to the site review criteria:\n(i)\tThe height modification is to allow a roof that has a pitch of 2:12 or greater in a building with three or fewer stories and the proposed height does not exceed the maximum height permitted in the zoning district by more than ten feet.\n(ii)\tThe building is in the industrial general, industrial service, or industrial manufacturing zoning district and has two or fewer stories and the building's height is necessary for a manufacturing, testing, or other industrial process or equipment.\n(iii)\tThe height modification is to allow up to the greater of two stories or the maximum number of stories permitted in Section 9-7-1, B.R.C. 1981, in a building and the height modification is necessary because of the topography of the site.\n(iv)\tThe height modification is to allow up to the greater of two stories or the maximum number of stories permitted but no more than five feet above the maximum building height under Section 9-7-5(a) or 9-7-6, B.R.C. 1981, in a building where the height modification is necessary because the building has to be elevated to meet the required flood protection elevation.\n(v)\tAt least forty percent of the dwelling units in the building meet the requirements for permanently affordable units in Chapter 9-13, \"Inclusionary Housing,\" B.R.C. 1981; at least forty percent of the floor area of the building is used for dwelling units that meet the requirements for permanently affordable units in Chapter 9-13, B.R.C. 1981; all floor area above the first floor of the building is used for dwelling units; and the permanently affordable units in the building are not used to satisfy inclusionary housing requirements under Chapter 9-13, B.R.C. 1981, for dwelling units located in any other building.\n(vi)\tThe height modification is to allow an emergency operations antenna or a pole.\n(vii)\tThe height modification is to allow an expansion of an existing building that exceeds the permitted height requirements of Section 9-7-5 or 9-7-6, B.R.C. 1981, if the existing height was approved as part of a planned unit development, site review, or height review and the expansion is not within a fourth or fifth story.\n(viii)\tThe building or use meets the requirements of Subparagraph 9-2-14(h)(6)(C), B.R.C. 1981, for a height bonus, and is not in the RR, RE, RL, RMX-1, MH, or A zoning district.\n(ix)\tThe building is in the public zoning district and is exclusively used for hospital or medical office uses or is a parking structure serving those uses.\nTABLE 2-2: SITE REVIEW THRESHOLD TABLE\n(2)\tPoles or Emergency Operations Antennas Above the Permitted Height: The city manager will follow the following procedures for the review, recommendation, and call-up for the approval of poles or emergency operations antennas, as applicable by height.\n(A)\tLight Poles at Government-Owned Facilities or Emergency Operations Antennas: The city manager will determine whether or not to approve an application for light poles at government-owned recreation facilities or emergency operations antennas between thirty-five and fifty-five feet in height, subject to call-up by the planning board pursuant to the procedures set forth in Subsection 9-2-7(b), B.R.C. 1981.\n(B)\tAll Poles or Antennas Over Fifty-Five Feet in Height: The city manager will determine whether or not to approve all applications for poles or antennas over fifty-five feet in height, subject to call-up by the city council pursuant to the procedures set forth in Subsection 9-2-7(c), B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tExceptions: The following developments that exceed the minimum site review thresholds set forth in this section shall not be required to complete a site review:\n(A)\tMinor modifications and amendments under this section to approved development review applications;\n(B)\tBuilding permits for additions to existing structures that do not exceed a cumulative total, over the life of the building, of twenty-five percent of the size of the building on which the addition is proposed and that do not alter the basic intent of an approved development;\n(C)\tSubdivisions solely for the purpose of amalgamating lots or parcels of land;\n(D)\tSubdivisions solely for the purpose of conveying property to the City;\n(E)\tCity of Boulder public projects that are otherwise required to complete a public review process;\n(F)\tProjects located in areas defined by Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" that are required to complete form-based code review pursuant to Section 9-2-16, \"Form-Based Code Review,\" B.R.C 1981;

In applying this, the approving authority shall consistently interpret and apply this criterion and consider whether a particular goal or policy is intended to be applied to individual development projects or is to guide city policy decisions, such as regulatory actions. The BVCP does not prioritize goals and policies, and no project must satisfy one particular goal or policy or all of them.\n(B)\tSubcommunity and Area Plans or Design Guidelines: If the project is subject to an adopted subcommunity or area plan or adopted design guidelines, the project is generally consistent with the applicable plan and guidelines.\n(C)\tReducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Any new commercial building greater than 30,000 square feet in floor area and any 30,000 square feet or greater addition to a commercial building shall either have a net site energy usage index (EUI) of zero or is designed to achieve a net site EUI that is 10 percent lower than required under the City of Boulder Energy Conservation Code. It shall be a condition of approval that the applicant demonstrate compliance with this criterion at time of building permit. For the purpose of this requirement, \"commercial building\" shall have the meaning defined in the City of Boulder Energy Conservation Code.\n(D)\tUrban Edge Design: If the project is located within the urbanizing areas along the boundaries between Area I and Area II or III of the BVCP, the building and site design provide for a well-defined urban edge, and, if, in addition, the project is located on a major street shown in Appendix A of this title, the buildings and site design establish a sense of entry and arrival to the city by creating a defined urban edge through site and building design elements visible upon entry to the city.\n(E)\tHistoric or Cultural Resources: If present, the project protects significant historic and cultural resources. The approving authority may require application and good faith pursuit of local landmark designation.\n(F)\tHousing Diversity and Bedroom Unit Types: Except in the RR, RE and RL-1 zoning districts, projects that are more than 50 percent residential by measure of floor area, not counting enclosed parking areas, meet the following housing and bedroom unit type requirements in Subparagraph (i) through (vi). For the purposes of this subparagraph, qualifying housing type shall mean duplexes, attached dwelling units, townhouses, live-work units, or efficiency living units, and bedroom type shall mean studios or units with different numbers of bedrooms such as one-bedroom units and two-bedroom units.\n(i)\tProjects five acres or less shall include at least one qualifying housing type. In projects with efficiency living units, at least one additional qualifying housing type shall be provided consistent with the requirements of this paragraph;\n(ii)\tProjects greater than five acres shall include at least two qualifying housing types;\n(iii)\tProjects ten acres or more shall include at least three qualifying housing types;\n(iv)\tProjects greater than five acres shall include at least five dwelling units of each required qualifying housing type;\n(v)\tProjects with more than 20 attached dwelling units shall include at least two different bedroom types; and\n(vi)\tIf a project does not meet the requirements of Subsections (i) through (v) above, the applicant shall demonstrate that the project fulfills another at least equivalent community need related to housing policies identified in the BVCP.\n(G)\tEnvironmental Preservation:\n(i)\tThe project provides for the preservation of or mitigation of adverse impacts to natural features, including, without limitation, healthy long-lived trees, significant plant communities, ground and surface water, wetlands, riparian areas, drainage areas, and species on the federal Endangered Species List and \"Species of Special Concern in Boulder County\" designated by Boulder County and their habitat.\n(ii)\tWhere excavation occurs, the location and design of buildings conforms to the natural contours of the land with tiered floor plates, and the site design avoids over-engineered tabling of land. Slopes greater than 50 percent should be avoided and, to the extent practicable, any such areas shall be stabilized with vegetation.\n(2)\tSite Design Criteria: The project creates safe, convenient, and efficient connections for all modes of travel, promotes safe pedestrian, bicycle, and other modes of alternative travel with the goal of lowering motor vehicle miles traveled. Usable open space is arranged to be accessible; designed to be functional, encourage use, and enhance the attractiveness of the project; and meets the needs of the anticipated residents, occupants, tenants, and visitors to the project. Landscaping aesthetically enhances the project, minimizes use of water, is sustainable, and improves the quality of the environment. Operational elements are screened to mitigate negative visual impacts. In determining whether this is met, the approving agency will consider the following factors:\n(A)\tAccess, Transportation, and Mobility:\n(i)\tThe project enables or provides vehicular and pedestrian connectivity between sites consistent with adopted connections plans relative to the transportation needs and impacts of the project, including but not limited to construction of new streets, bike lanes, on-street parking, sidewalks, multi-use paths, transit stops, streetscape planting strips, and dedication of public right-of-way or public access easements, as applicable considering the scope of the project. Where no adopted connections plan applies, the applicant shall, in good faith, and in coordination with the city manager, attempt to coordinate with adjacent property owners to establish, where practicable, reasonable and useful pedestrian connections or vehicular circulation connections, such as between parking lots on abutting properties, considering existing connections, infrastructure, and topography.\n(ii)\tAlternatives to the automobile are promoted by incorporating site design techniques, land use patterns, and infrastructure that support and encourage walking, biking, and other alternatives to the single-occupant vehicle.\n(iii)\tA transportation demand management (TDM) plan will be complied with including methods that result in a significant shift away from single-occupant vehicle use to alternate modes.\n(iv)\tStreets, bikeways, pedestrian ways, trails, open space, buildings, and parking areas are designed and located to optimize safety of all modes and provide connectivity and functional permeability through the site.\n(v)\tThe design of vehicular circulation and parking areas make efficient use of the land and minimize the amount of pavement.\n(vi)\tWhere practicable and needed in the area and subject to coordination with the city manager, the project provides curbside parking or loading or both consistent with city policies on curbside management.\n(B)\tOpen Space:\n(i)\tUseable open space is arranged to be accessible and designed to encourage use by incorporating quality landscaping, a mixture of sun and shade, hardscape areas and green spaces for gathering.\n(ii)\tThe open space will meet the needs of the anticipated residents, occupants, tenants, and visitors of the property. In mixed-use projects, the open space provides for a balance of private and common areas for the residential uses and includes common open space that is available for use by residents of the residential uses and their visitors and by tenants, occupants, customers, and visitors of the non-residential uses.\n(iii)\tIf the project includes more than 50 dwelling units, including the addition of units that causes a project to exceed this threshold, and is more than one mile walking distance to a public park, at least 30 percent of the required outdoor open space is designed for active recreational purposes.\n(iv)\tOn-site open space is linked to adjacent public spaces, multi-use paths, city parks, or public open space if consistent with Department of Open Space and Mountain Parks or Department of Parks and Recreation plans and planning for the area, as applicable.\n(C)\tLandscaping and Screening:\n(i)\tThe project exceeds the minimum landscaping requirements of Section 9-9-12, \"Landscaping and Screening Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, by at least fifteen percent in terms of planting quantities, includes a commensurate area to accommodate the additional plantings, and, where practical, preserves healthy long-lived trees.\n(ii)\tThe landscaping design includes a variety of plants providing a variety of colors and contrasts in terms of texture and seasonality and high-quality hard surface materials, such as stone, flagstone, porous pavers, and decorative concrete.\n(iii)\tThe landscaping design conserves water through use of native and adaptive plants, reduction of exotic plant materials, and landscaping within stormwater detention facilities to create bioswales or rain gardens, or other similar design strategies.\n(iv)\tOperational elements, such as electrical transformers, trash storage and recycling areas, parking, and vehicular circulation, are screened from the public realm through design elements, such as landscaping, fencing, or placement of structures, to mitigate negative visual impacts.\n(3)\tBuilding Siting and Design Criteria: Building siting and design are consistent with the character established in any adopted plans or guidelines applicable to the site or, if none apply, are compatible with the character of the area or improves upon that character, consistent with the intent specified in this paragraph. Buildings are positioned and oriented towards the public realm to promote a safe and vibrant pedestrian experience including welcoming, well-defined entries and facades. Building exteriors are designed with a long-lasting appearance and high-quality materials. Building design is simple and to a human scale, it creates visual interest and a vibrant pedestrian experience. Building roof design contributes to a city skyline that has a variety of roof forms and heights. In determining whether this is met, the approving agency will consider the following factors:\n(A)\tBuilding Siting and Public Realm Interface:\n(i)\tNew buildings and, to the extent practicable, additions to existing buildings are positioned towards the street, respecting the existing conditions or the context anticipated by adopted plans or guidelines. In urban contexts, buildings are positioned close to the property line and sidewalk along a street; whereas, in lower intensity contexts, a greater landscaped setback may be provided to match the surrounding context.\n(ii)\tWherever practical considering the scope of the project, parking areas are located behind buildings or set back further from the streetscape than the building façade.\n(iii)\tAlong the public realm, building entries are emphasized by windows and architectural features that include one or more of the following: increased level of detail, protruding or recessed elements, columns, pilasters, protruding bays, reveals, fins, ribs, balconies, cornices, eaves, increased window glazing, or changes in building materials or color.\n(iv)\tDefined entries connect the building to the public realm. Unless inconsistent with the context and building's use, along the public realm, one defined entry is provided every 50 feet. Buildings designed for residential or industrial uses may have fewer defined entries.\n(v)\tIf the project is adjacent to a zoning district of lower intensity in terms of allowable use, density, massing, or scale, the project is designed with an appropriate transition to the adjacent properties considering adopted subcommunity and area plans or design guidelines applicable to the site, and, if none apply, the existing development pattern. Appropriate transitions may be created through design elements such as building siting and design or open space siting and design.\n(vi)\tThe building's siting and relationship to the public realm is consistent with the character established in any adopted plans or guidelines applicable to the site or, if none apply, is compatible with the character of the area or improves upon that character, consistent with the intent of Paragraph (3), Building Design Criteria.\n(B)\tBuilding Design:\n(i)\tLarger floor plate buildings and projects with multiple buildings have a variety of forms and heights.\n(ii)\tTo the extent practical considering their function, mechanical appurtenances are located within or concealed by the building. If they cannot be located within or concealed by the building, their visibility from the public realm and adjacent properties is minimized.\n(iii)\tOn each floor of the building, windows create visual interest, transparency, and a sense of connection to the public realm. In urban, pedestrian main street-built environments, it is a best practice to design at least 60 percent of each ground floor façade facing the street as window area. Otherwise, it is a best practice to design at least 20 percent of the wall on each floor of a building as window area. Blank walls along the most visible portions of the building are avoided.\n(iv)\tSimple detailing is incorporated into the façades to create visual interest, without making the façade overly complicated. This detailing may include cornices, belt courses, reveals, alternating brick or stone patterns, expression line offsets, window lintels and sills, and offsets in window glass from surrounding materials.\n(v)\tBalconies on buildings with attached dwelling units are integrated into the form of the building in that exterior walls partially enclose the balcony. Balcony platform undersides are finished.\n(vi)\tThe building's design, including but not limited to use of materials, color, roof forms, and style, is consistent with the character established in any adopted plans or guidelines applicable to the site or, if none apply, is compatible with the character of the area or improves upon that character, consistent with the intent of paragraph (3), Building Design Criteria.\n(C)\tBuilding Materials:\n(i)\tBuilding facades are composed of high-quality, durable, human-scaled materials. High-quality materials include brick, stone, polished concrete masonry units, wood, architectural high pressure laminate panels, cementitious or composite siding, architectural metal panels, or any combination of these materials. Split-faced concrete masonry units, stucco, vinyl siding, EIFS, and unfinished or untreated wood are not considered durable, high-quality materials, but may be used on a limited basis and not on facades facing the public realm. High quality materials are focused on the ground floor facades on all sides of a building and on all floors of facades facing the public realm, and, overall, comprise the vast majority of all building facades.\n(ii)\tMonolithic roofing membranes, like Thermoplastic Polyolefin, are not used on roof surfaces that are visible from the street level.\n(iii)\tThe number of building material types is limited, and the building materials are applied to complement the building form and function. The organization of the building materials logically expresses primary building features, such as the spatial layout, building entries, private and common spaces, anchor corners, stairwells, and elevators.\n(iv)\tBuilding cladding materials turn convex corners and continue to the inset wall. This criterion does not apply to changes that occur at an interior corner nor to detailing elements, such as cornices, belt courses, reveals, offsets in expression lines, lintels, and windowsills. Building cladding materials do not change in-plane unless there is at least a 12-inch wall offset.\n(v)\tAny newly constructed building that includes residential units and is located within 200 feet of a railroad, freeway, or expressway is designed to achieve an interior day-night average noise level of no more than forty-five decibels. Noise shall be measured in a manner that is consistent with the federal Housing and Urban Development's standards in Sections 24 CFR §§ 51.100 to 51.106 for the \"measure of external noise environments,\" or similar standard adopted by the city manager in the event that such rule is repealed. The applicant shall provide written certification prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy that the sound abatement and attenuation measures were incorporated in the construction and site design as recommended by a professional engineer.\n(4)\tAdditional Criteria for Buildings Requiring Height Modification or Exceeding the Maximum Floor Area Ratio: Any building exceeding the by-right or conditional zoning district height as permitted by Section 9-2-14(b)(1)(E), B.R.C. 1981, and any building exceeding the by-right floor area limits as permitted by Section 9-2-14(h)(6)(B), B.R.C. 1981, shall meet the following requirements:\n(A)\tBuilding Form and Massing: The building's form and massing are consistent with the character established in any adopted plans or guidelines applicable to the site or, if none apply, are compatible with the character of the area or improves upon that character, consistent with the intent of paragraph (3), Building Design Criteria. The building's form, massing and length are designed to a human scale and to create visual permeability into and through sites. In determining whether this is met, the approving authority will consider the following factors:\n(i)\tThe building does not exceed 200 feet in length along any public right-of-way.\n(ii)\tAll building facades exceeding 120 feet in length along a public street, excluding alleys, are designed to appear as at least two distinct buildings. To achieve this, façade segments vary in at least two of the following design elements:\na.\tType of dominant material or color, scale, or orientation of that material;\nb.\tFacade recessions and projections;\nc.\tLocation of entrance and window placements;\nd.\tRoof forms; and\ne.\tBuilding height.\n(B)\tBuilding and Site Design Requirements for Height Modifications:\n(i)\tBuildings requiring a height modification shall meet the following requirements:\na.\tHeight Modification Other than Height Bonus: For buildings no taller than three stories and subject to a height modification pursuant to Subparagraph 9-2-14(b)(1)(E)(i) through (vii) and (ix), the building's height, mass, and scale is compatible with the character of the surrounding area.\nb.\tHeight Bonus: For buildings taller than three stories subject to a height modification pursuant to Subparagraph 9-2-14(b)(1)(E)(viii), B.R.C. 1981:\n1.\tGuidelines or Plan: The building's height is consistent with the building heights anticipated in adopted design guidelines or subcommunity or area plans for the area; or\n2.\tNo Guidelines or Plan: If no such guidelines or plans are adopted for the area or if they do not specify anticipated heights for buildings, the building height is compatible with the height of buildings in the surrounding area or the building is located (1) near a multi-modal corridor with transit service or (2) near an area of redevelopment where a higher intensity of use and similar building height is anticipated; and\n3.\tAdditional Requirements for a Height Bonus - Views: The project preserves and takes advantage of prominent mountain views from public spaces and from common areas within the project. In determining whether this is met, the approving authority will consider the following factors:\ni.\tIf there are prominent mountain views from the site, usable open spaces on the site or elevated common areas on the building are located and designed to allow users of the site access to such views;\nii.\tIf the proposed building is located adjacent to a city-managed public park, plaza, or open space, buildings are sited or designed in a manner that avoids or minimizes blocking of prominent public views of the mountains from these spaces;\n4.\tAdditional Requirements for a Height Bonus - Open Space: If the project site is greater than one acre in size, an inviting outdoor garden or landscaped courtyard is provided, designed as a gathering space for the building users. In determining whether this requirement is met, the approving authority will consider the following factors as successful design elements for such a space, as practicable considering site conditions and location:\ni.\tThe horizontal dimensions of the space are no less than the height of building walls enclosing the space;\nii.\tSeating and other design elements are integrated with the circulation pattern of the project;\niii.\tThe space has southern exposure and sunlight;\niv.\tHard surface areas are paved with unit pavers, such as bricks, quarry tiles, or porous pavers, or poured-in-place materials. If poured-in-place materials are used, they are of decorative color or textures;\nv.\tAmenities, such as seating, tables, grills, planting, shade, horseshoe pits, playground equipment, and lighting are incorporated into the space;\nvi.\tThe space is visible from an adjoining public sidewalk and is not elevated above the building's first story; and\nvii.\tAt least one tree is planted per 500 square feet of space. The trees are planted in the ground or, if over parking garages, in tree vaults.\n(5)\tAdditional Criteria for Poles or Emergency Operations Antennas Above the Permitted Height: No site review application for a pole or for an emergency operations antenna above the permitted height will be approved unless the approving agency finds the following:\n(A)\tPoles: Poles meet all the following:\n(i)\tThe pole is a light pole that is required for nighttime recreation activities which are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood, a light or traffic signal pole that is required for safety, or an electrical utility pole that is required to serve the needs of the city;\n(ii)\tThe pole is sited in a manner that minimizes visual impacts and preserves public view corridors; and\n(iii)\tThe pole is at the minimum height appropriate to accomplish the purposes for which the pole is erected and is designed and constructed to minimize light and electromagnetic pollution.\n(B)\tEmergency Operation Antennas: Emergency operations antennas meet the following:\n(i)\tThe emergency operations antenna will serve a critical health and safety need for the city, surrounding communities, or both and is sited and designed in a manner that respects its context to the highest degree possible and minimizes visual impacts. The antenna is at the minimum height necessary to accomplish its purpose.\n(6)\tLand Use Intensity and Height Modifications: Modifications to minimum open space on lots, floor area ratio (FAR), maximum height, and number of dwelling units per acre requirements will be approved pursuant to the standards of this subparagraph:\n(A)\tLand Use Intensity Modifications with Open Space Reduction:\n(i)\tIn the DT, BMS, BR-2, and MU-3 Zoning Districts: The open space requirements in Chapter 9-8, \"Intensity Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, may be reduced in all DT districts and the BR-2, BMS, and MU-3 districts subject to the following standards:\na.\tIn the DT, BMS, or MU-3 zoning districts, the reduction in open space is necessary to avoid siting of open space that is inconsistent with the urban context of neighborhood buildings or the character established in adopted design guidelines or plans for the area, such as along a property line next to zero-setback buildings or along alleys: maximum one hundred percent reduction.\nb.\tIn the BR-2 zoning district, at least one of the following shall be met:\n1.\tThe reduction in open space is part of a development with a mix of residential and nonresidential uses that, due to the ratio of residential to nonresidential uses and because of the size, type and mix of dwelling units, has a reduced need for open space: maximum fifteen percent reduction; and\n2.\tThe reduction in open space is part of a development with a mix of residential and nonresidential uses with high quality urban design elements. This open space will meet the needs of anticipated residents, occupants, tenants, and visitors of the property or will accommodate public gatherings, and may include, without limitation, recreational or cultural amenities, intimate spaces that foster social interaction, street furniture, landscaping, gardens, sculptures, and hard surface treatments: maximum twenty-five percent reduction.\n(B)\tLand Use Intensity Modifications with Height Bonus: In the BMS, BR-1, IMS, IS, MU-1, and MU-2 zoning districts if associated with a request for a height bonus, the floor area of a building may be increased above the maximum allowed in Chapter 9-8, \"Intensity Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, as follows, provided the building meets the requirements for a height bonus under Subparagraph 9-2-14(h)(6)(C), B.R.C. 1981:\n(i)\tIn the BMS zoning district outside a general improvement district providing off-street parking, and in the IMS, IS, MU-1, and MU-2 zoning districts, the base floor area ratio (FAR) in Table 8-2, Section 9-8-2, \"Floor Area Ratio Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981, may be increased by up to 0.5 FAR.\n(ii)\tIn the BR-1 zoning district, the maximum allowable floor area ratio (FAR) may be increased up to a 3.0 FAR.\n(C)\tAdditional Criteria for a Height Bonus and Land Use Intensity Modifications: A building proposed with a fourth or fifth story or addition thereto that exceeds the permitted height requirements of Section 9-7-5, \"Building Height,\" or 9-7-6, \"Building Height, Conditional,\" B.R.C. 1981, together with any additional floor area or residential density approved under Subparagraph (h)(6)(B), may be approved if it meets the requirements of this Subparagraph (h)(6)(C). For purposes of this Subparagraph(h)(6)(C), bonus floor area shall mean floor area that is on a fourth or fifth story and is partially or fully above the permitted height and any floor area that is the result of an increase in density or floor area described in Subparagraph (h)(6)(B). The approving authority may approve a height up to fifty-five feet if one of the following criteria is met:\n(i)\tResidential Developments: If the development is residential, it will exceed the requirements of Subparagraph 9-13-3(a)(1)(A), B.R.C. 1981, as follows:\na.\tFor bonus units, the inclusionary housing requirement under Chapter 9-13, \"Inclusionary Housing,\" B.R.C. 1981, shall be increased by eleven percent. The resulting inclusionary requirement may be satisfied by any option allowed in Chapter 9-13 to meet inclusionary housing requirements. For example, if Chapter 9-13 requires twenty-five percent of units to be permanently affordable, for bonus units that requirement is increased by eleven percent so that at least thirty-six percent of the total number of bonus units must be permanently affordable units.\nb.\tFor purposes of this Subparagraph (i), bonus units shall mean a number of units that is determined as follows: A percentage of all the units in the building that equals in number the percentage of bonus floor area in the building. For example, if twenty percent of the building's floor area is bonus floor area and the building has one hundred units, twenty percent of those one hundred units are bonus units, resulting in twenty bonus units.\nc.\tThe city manager shall review the development's compliance with this increased inclusionary housing requirement pursuant to the standards and review procedures of Chapter 9-13, \"Inclusionary Housing,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(ii)\tNon-Residential Developments: For non-residential developments, the applicant shall pay the affordable housing portion of the capital facility impact fee in Section 4-20-62, B.R.C. 1981, at a rate of 1.43 above the base requirement for the bonus floor area. In a building with several types of non-residential uses, the bonus floor area of each type identified under Section 4-20-62, B.R.C. 1981, shall be a percentage of the bonus floor area that equals in number the percentage of the total floor area in the building of such use type. For nonresidential uses with a fee that is calculated per room or bed under Section 4-20-62, B.R.C. 1981, the increased rate for the affordable housing portion of the fee shall apply to bonus rooms or bonus beds as applicable under that section; the number of bonus rooms or bonus beds shall be determined consistent with the methodology for bonus units in Subparagraph (i)b. above.\n(iii)\tMixed Use: If the development is a residential mixed-use development, the requirements of Subsections (i) and (ii) above shall apply to the bonus floor area according to the percentage of the total building floor area of each use.\n(iv)\tAlternative Community Benefit: Pursuant to the standard in this Subparagraph (iv), the approving authority may approve an alternative method of compliance to provide additional benefits to the community and qualify for a height bonus together with any additional floor area or density that may be approved under Subparagraph (h)(6)(B). The approving authority will approve the alternative method of compliance if the applicant proposes the alternative method of compliance and demonstrates that the proposed method:\na.\tWill improve the facilities or services delivered by the city, including without limitation any police, fire, human services, parks and recreation, or other municipal facility, land or service, or will provide an arts, cultural, human services, housing, environmental or other benefit that is a community benefit objective in the BVCP, and\nb.\tIs of a value that is equivalent to or greater than the benefits required by this Subparagraph (h)(6)(C).\n(i)\tPlanning Board Call-Up: The planning board may call-up any final site review decision by the city manager pursuant to Section 9-4-4, \"Appeals, Call-Ups and Public Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(j)\tSubdivisions: An approved site plan may be subdivided under Chapter 9-12, \"Subdivision,\" B.R.C. 1981.

The preservation of streams, wetlands, and water bodies under this section is consistent with the goal of wetland protection set forth in the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan.\n(2)\tThe city council finds that many streams, wetlands, and water bodies have been either lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, channelizing, polluting, and other acts. Piecemeal and cumulative losses destroy or diminish the functions of the remaining streams, wetlands, and water bodies.\n(3)\tThe city council finds that it is necessary for the city to ensure protection by discouraging development activities in streams, wetlands, and water bodies and those activities at adjacent sites that may adversely affect the visibility and functional values of these resources.\n(4)\tThe city council finds that it is necessary to ensure no net loss of wetlands, by encouraging avoidance of direct or indirect impacts from activities that destroy or diminish the quantity, quality, and biological diversity of the city's water resources and adjacent buffers.\n(5)\tThe city council acknowledges that much of the city was developed prior to awareness of the value of protecting streams, wetlands, and water bodies. The city council seeks to find a reasonable balance between the property owners' desire to make reasonable uses of their properties and the public's interest in preserving and protecting these important water resources. When the destruction or diminution in function of these resources cannot be avoided, the city council finds that impacts on streams, wetlands, and water bodies should be minimized and mitigation provided for unavoidable losses.\n(6)\tNothing in this section shall be construed to prevent irrigation companies from altering water levels through the diverting, storage, or delivery of water under their historic water rights or owners of such rights from exercising those historic rights.\n(7)\tNothing in this section shall be construed to prevent compliance with applicable state or federal statutes and regulations.\n(8)\tIt is not the intent of this section to prohibit all activities within the regulated area, but rather to encourage avoidance and minimization of regulated activities within the regulated area to mitigate the impact that these activities have on streams, wetlands, and water bodies.\n(b)\tScope and Application: No person shall violate any provision of this section or fail to obtain a permit for any regulated activity or to use best management practices in regulated areas as required by this section.\n(1)\tRegulated Area: This section applies to the following:\n(A)\tAreas within the city shown on the streams, wetlands, and water bodies maps adopted pursuant to this subsection, as amended;\n(B)\tAll streams, wetlands, and water bodies on city owned or managed lands inside or outside the city limits;\n(C)\tAll city activities affecting streams, wetlands, and water bodies inside or outside of the city limits;\n(D)\tInner and outer buffer areas associated with all of the above and as defined in Paragraph (l)(3) of this section.\n(2)\tExempt Wetlands: Isolated wetlands with a size of less than four hundred square feet, regardless of property boundaries, are exempt from this section unless the wetland site provides habitat for the following species:\n(A)\tPlant, animal or other wildlife species listed as threatened or endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; or\n(B)\tPlant, animal or other wildlife species listed by the State of Colorado as rare, threatened or endangered, or as a species of special concern; or\n(C)\tPlant, animal or other wildlife species listed in the Boulder County Comprehensive Plan as critical; or\n(D)\tPlant, animal or other wildlife species listed in the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan as a species of local concern.\n(3)\tRegulatory Maps: Stream, wetland and water body regulatory maps are hereby adopted and will be maintained on file in the planning department.\n(4)\tMost Stringent Restrictions Prevail: It is not intended that this section repeal, abrogate, supersede or impair any existing federal, state or local law, easement, covenant or deed restriction. However, if this section imposes greater or more stringent restrictions or requirements, the provisions of this section shall prevail. Specifically, if an applicant for a wetlands permit pursuant to this section also acquires authorization under section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the applicant shall meet any greater or more stringent restrictions or requirements set forth in this section in addition to and independent of the restrictions of such permit.\n(c)\tPermitted, Allowed and Prohibited Uses within the Regulated Area: The purpose of this subsection is to describe activities that are exempted, conditionally permitted, requiring development review or prohibited:\n(1)\tExplanation of Table Abbreviations: The abbreviations used in the cells in table 3-1 have the following meanings:\n\"E\" (Exempted Activities): Indicates that the use type is allowed as a matter of right and no stream, wetland or water body permit is required.\n\"C\" (Conditional Use Review): Indicates that the use type will be reviewed in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.\n\"S\" (Standard Permit Review): Indicates that the use type will be reviewed in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.\n\"P\" (Prohibited Activities): Indicates that the use type is prohibited in the zone.\n\"N\" (Allowed with Notice): Indicates that the use type is allowed as a matter of right subject to the application of best management practices as defined in chapter 9-16, \"Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981, and provision of notice in paragraph (5) of this subsection.

A mitigation plan requires the applicant to engage in the enhancement, restoration or creation of a stream, wetland or water body in order to offset, in whole or in part, the losses or impacts resulting from that applicant's actions. This mitigation plan shall not be an alternative to the standards set forth in this subsection, but shall be used only to compensate for unavoidable losses or impacts. In making a determination of whether a mitigation plan will be required, and the degree to which it is required, the following factors will be considered:\n(A)\tThe type and value of the altered stream, wetland or water body adopted functions, the functions and associated resources to be impaired or destroyed as a result of the proposed regulated activity, and the ecological equivalency of the enhanced, restored or created stream, wetland or water body. In considering whether the enhanced, restored or created wetland is the ecological equivalent to the stream, wetland or water body impaired or destroyed, the city manager will accept an evaluation of functional values comparing the impaired or destroyed stream, wetland or water body and the proposed enhanced, restored or created stream, wetland or water body using the procedures described in \"City of Boulder, Comprehensive Wetland Remapping Project,\" by Land Stewardship Consulting, October 18, 2004. In interpreting the provisions of this section, the city manager may adopt design standards pursuant to chapter 1-4, Rulemaking,\" B.R.C. 1981;\n(B)\tThe type, size and location of the altered stream, wetland or water body and gains or losses of this particular type of resource in the Boulder Valley planning area and in the area of the altered stream, wetland or water body; and\n(C)\tThe cost and probability of success of the mitigation measures.\n(2)\tMitigation Plan Requirements: A mitigation plan shall contain:\n(A)\tAn evaluation of all of the factors set forth in paragraph (1) above;\n(B)\tThe location and ownership of the proposed mitigation site;\n(C)\tAn evaluation of the suitability of the proposed mitigation site for establishing the restored or created stream, wetland or water body;\n(D)\tThe source and ownership of any water to be used for establishing or maintaining the restored or created stream, wetland or water body;\n(E)\tA description of the sizes and types of stream reaches, wetlands or water bodies to be impaired or destroyed and restored or created;\n(F)\tThe site hydrology of the restoration or creation area;\n(G)\tA maintenance program for a period of up to five years, including, without limitation, weed control, litter and debris removal, temporary irrigation, repair of water control structures, maintenance of vegetation and wildlife habitat and clearing of culverts;\n(H)\tA description of any critical elements and possible problems that may influence the success of the project;\n(I)\tA timetable for construction and monitoring;\n(J)\tA monitoring program, including monitoring schedule, technique and success criteria; and\n(K)\tA demonstration of fiscal, administrative and technical competence to successfully execute the overall project.\n(3)\tMitigation Location: Selection of a location for an enhancement, restoration or creation project shall consider the following order of geographic preferences in the context of the goals of this section:\n(A)\tOn-site;\n(B)\tAdjacent to the site;\n(C)\tWithin the sub-basin of the existing wetland;\n(D)\tWithin the Boulder Valley planning area; or\n(E)\tIn unusual cases, outside the Boulder Valley planning area.\n(4)\tMitigation Type:\n(A)\tIn a mitigation plan, replication of the same or greater stream, wetland or water body functional value is required (in-kind replacement), unless a wetland of a different type is justified based on the functions and values of the stream, wetland or water body which is proposed to be altered.\n(B)\tPermanent, direct impacts to streams, wetlands or water bodies shall be compensated through restoration or creation.\n(C)\tTemporary, direct impacts to streams, wetlands or water bodies shall be compensated through restoration or enhancement at the location of impact at a 1:1 ratio.\n(D)\tIndirect impacts as a result of activities within a buffer area shall be compensated through enhancement of the buffer area that compensates for the impacted function.\n(5)\tCompensatory Mitigation Amount:\n(A)\tThe guidelines for wetland compensation indicating the amount of impacted streams, wetlands or water bodies to be restored or created compared to the area destroyed or impaired are in table 3-2 of this subsection. Wetland and water body compensation shall be based on total surface area.\nTABLE 3-2: WETLAND COMPENSATION\n(B)\tHigher wetland compensation ratios may be applied to mitigation that is not in-kind and/or outside the sub-basin of the original wetland.\n(C)\tA combination of creation, restoration and enhancement for direct impacts that meets the above compensation requirements may be considered under the following conditions:\n(i)\tWater rights for agricultural use within the sub-basin are unavailable;\n(ii)\tCreated, restored or enhanced wetlands are all within the basin of the original wetland; and\n(iii)\tThere is a high potential for long-term success of mitigation.\n(6)\tMitigation Banking Program: Upon adoption of a wetland mitigation banking program by the city council, if the city manager, the planning board or the city council determines that the public interest is better served, a fee may be accepted in lieu of direct action on the part of the applicant to initiate a wetland restoration or wetland creation project to offset wetland destruction or impairment from the permitted activity. Fees for compensation of wetland destruction or impairment will be set based upon the amount that would be required to perform equivalent wetland restoration or creation. Such fees shall be held for the express use of wetland restoration and creation projects, including, without limitation, the acquisition of water rights for the use of compensatory mitigation.\n(7)\tMitigation Monitoring and Release of Mitigation Plan Responsibilities:\n(A)\tThe applicant and any successor owner of any portion of any property subject to a wetland permit is responsible for the implementation of any related stream, wetland or water body mitigation plan for an initial period of up to five years from the date of completion of construction and planting of all vegetation required by the plan and acceptance of such construction and planting by the city manager.\n(B)\tAny failure of a mitigation plan during the monitoring period shall be remedied by the applicant and any successor owner of any portion of the property, who shall be jointly and severally liable to the city for the costs of such remedy. Any such failure shall trigger a new guarantee period of equivalent length to that specified in the stream, wetland or water body permit. The city manager will release the financial guarantee required by subsection (h) of this section at the end of the monitoring period if the original goals of the plan have been achieved.\n(g)\tPermit Issuance:\n(1)\tPermit Decision: The city manager shall determine whether the application meets the requirements of this section and shall approve a permit, approve a permit with conditions or deny the application. Standard permits shall be final fourteen days after issuance. Conditional use permits shall be final upon issuance.\n(2)\tPermit Conditions: The approving authority may attach such conditions to the granting of a stream, wetland or water body permit as are reasonably necessary to carry out this section. To the extent necessary for the regulated activity to take place without adverse impact on the stream, wetland or water body, such conditions may include, without limitation:\n(A)\tRequiring that structures be elevated on piles and otherwise protected against natural or man-made hazards;\n(B)\tRestricting the use of an area;\n(C)\tRequiring erosion control and stormwater management measures;\n(D)\tRestricting fill, deposit of soil and other activities which may be detrimental to a stream, wetland or water body;\n(E)\tModifying the project design to ensure continued water supply or other necessary protections for the purpose of maintaining stream, wetland or water body functions;\n(F)\tRequiring compliance with best management practices as described in chapter 9-16, \"Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981;\n(G)\tRequiring or restricting maintenance of a regulated area for the purpose of maintaining stream, wetland or water body functions; and\n(H)\tRequiring submission and approval of a mitigation plan as set forth in subsection (f) of this section.\n(3)\tGeneral Permits: The city manager may issue a general permit for up to five years for on-going operational activities such as, without limitation, stormwater facility management, stream channel sediment removal and repair or replacement of other public facilities.\n(4)\tNo person who has obtained a permit shall fail to conduct an activity in accordance with their approved application.\n(5)\tReferrals, Call-up or Appeal:\n(A)\tConditional Use Permits: For conditional use permits, there shall be no referrals, call-ups or appeals. An applicant may resubmit a standard permit application for a denied conditional use application, pay the balance of the standard permit fee and proceed pursuant to the standard permit review process.\n(B)\tStandard Review Permits: The decision of the city manager may be appealed by the applicant to the planning board, subject to the appeal procedure of Section 9-4-4 \"Appeals, Call-Ups and Public Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(h)\tFinancial Guarantees:\n(1)\tThe city manager may require a financial guarantee in an amount, and with surety and conditions, sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions and limitations set forth in the permit.\n(2)\tMitigation Plan Guarantee: Prior to receiving a final certificate of occupancy, the applicant and any successor owner of any portion of the property subject to a stream, wetland or water body mitigation requirement shall either complete the mitigation or provide a financial guarantee in an amount sufficient to guarantee the performance of the mitigation plan. If a building permit is not required for a proposed activity, a financial guarantee is required prior to issuance of a wetland permit. The guarantee shall be in an amount necessary to secure the full costs, as determined by the city manager, of construction and monitoring as described in the approved mitigation plan.\n(3)\tThe financial guarantee may be in any of the forms as described in subsection 9-12-13(f), B.R.C. 1981. If the financial guarantee is in the form of the escrow of funds, the city manager will take the measures described in subsection 9-12-13(g), B.R.C. 1981, to ensure that the funds are maintained in an appropriate manner.\n(4)\tAnnual Review: The city manager shall review the financial guarantee annually to assure that it meets the full current cost of installing or completing the mitigation plan that it guarantees and may require the recipient of the permit to augment the guarantee to meet such costs.\n(5)\tCollection: If the mitigation plan is not completed within the required time, the city manager may cause it to be completed and collect against the financial guarantee, or, if the guarantee is exhausted, against the property owner for the full cost of completion.\n(i)\tPermit Amendment Procedures:\n(1)\tChanges to conditions of an approved permit or changes to an approved mitigation plan may be approved by the city manager without submittal of a new application if such changes are minor. Applicants for a minor change to a wetland permit must pay the fee for a revision as prescribed in section 4-20-53, \"Stream, Wetland and Water Body Permit and Map Revision Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981. All minor changes to the permit shall be noted, signed and dated on the approved permit.\n(2)\tIf an applicant proposes to amend an approved permit and the proposed amendment is not considered minor by the city manager, the applicant must submit a complete application and pay the fee for a standard wetland permit as prescribed in section 4-20-53, \"Stream, Wetland and Water Body Permit and Map Revision Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(j)\tExpiration of Permit:\n(1)\tUnless otherwise specified, a stream, wetland or water body permit expires three years after the date of final approval.\n(2)\tFor good cause, an applicant or any successor owner of any portion of land subject to a stream, wetland or water body permit may request an extension of an original permit by filing an application with the city manager prior to the expiration date of the permit, for up to an additional three-year period. The city manager may deny the request if good cause is not shown, if the original intent of the permit is altered or extended by the renewal or if the applicant failed to abide by the terms of the original permit.\n(k)\tStream, Wetland and Water Body Boundaries:\n(1)\tFor the purpose of mapping the boundaries of a stream, wetland or water body, the following standards and criteria shall be used:\n(A)\tWetland boundary determinations shall be performed in accordance with the procedures specified in the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual or defined in chapter 9-16, \"Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(B)\tThe boundaries of a stream shall include the bank-full width of the channel.\n(C)\tThe boundaries of a water body shall include the ordinary high water mark.\n(2)\tAnnexation: Prior to annexation, all stream, wetland, water bodies and buffer areas on the property to be annexed shall be mapped by the City after the fee prescribed in section 4-20-53, \"Stream, Wetland and Water Body Permit and Map Revision Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981, is paid and according to the procedures set forth in this section.

The setback for the adjacent buildings and other buildings on the block face shall be measured from the property line to the bulk of the building, excluding, without limitation, any unenclosed porches, decks, patios or steps. The bulk of the building setback shall not be less than the average bulk of the building setback for the principal buildings on the two adjacent lots. Where there is only one adjacent lot, the front yard setback reduction shall be based on the average of the principal building setbacks on the two closest lots on the same block face. (See Figure 7-1 of this section.)\nFigure 7-1: Setback Averaging Example\nIn this example, lots \"B\" through \"F\" are the face block. Lot \"A\" is not included in the face block, as the front of this lot is on a different street. Setback averaging is measured to the bulk of the buildings and does not include porches.\nAssuming this block is zoned RL-1, the minimum required front yard setback would be twenty-five feet. The block face shown would qualify for setback averaging, as more than fifty percent of the principal buildings do not meet the required front yard setback. An addition to the front of lot \"E\" would require the averaging of the setbacks of lots \"D\" and \"F\", the two closest buildings on the same block face. In this example the resulting setback would be 20 feet - the average of lot \"D\" (fifteen feet) and lot \"F\" (twenty-five feet). An addition to the front of lot \"F\" would be based on the average of the two closest buildings on the same block face; in this case, lots \"D\" and \"E.\"\n(c)\tSide Yard Setback Standards:\n(1)\tSetbacks for Upper Floors in Non-Residential Zoning Districts: A principal building constructed with a side yard setback of zero for the first story above grade in the BC-2, BR-1, DT-1, DT-2, DT-3, DT-4, DT-5, IS-1, IG or IM zoning districts, where the side yard setback is noted as \"0 or 12,\" may have upper stories set back either five feet or the distance required by Chapter 10-5 \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981, whichever is greater.\n(2)\tMaintenance Easements Required in Residential Zoning Districts: In residential zoning districts that allow a zero side yard or rear yard setback, the applicant shall be required to secure a recorded maintenance easement from the adjoining property owner if the zero setback side is not attached to another structure. The easement shall be effective for the life of the building. The easement shall not be less than three feet in width measured parallel to that portion of the building at zero setback.\n(3)\tWall Height for Residential Zero Lot Line: The maximum wall height for detached dwelling units at the zero setback property line shall be twelve feet. Townhouses, consistent with Subparagraph (7), below, are not subject to this restriction.\n(4)\tCalculating Residential Zero Lot Line Side Yard Setbacks: For detached dwelling units, the side yard setback opposite the zero setback property line shall be the sum of both side yards for the district.\n(5)\tCombined Side Yard Setbacks: When combined side yard setbacks are required by Section 9-7-1, \"Schedule of Form and Bulk Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, the resulting structure, including the existing structure and any addition, must meet the combined side yard setback requirements. (See Figure 7-2 of this section for compliant and noncompliant examples.)\nFigure 7-2: Combined Side Yard Setbacks\nExample: In the RL-1 district, the combination of side yard setbacks must be no less than fifteen feet, with a minimum of five feet. Both existing structures and additions (hatched) are included in the calculation.\n(6)\tExisting Nonstandard Side Yard Setbacks for Existing Detached Dwelling Units: A second story addition that does not comply with the minimum interior or combined side yard setbacks may be added to an existing detached dwelling unit subject to the following:\n(A)\tThe interior side yard setback for the existing detached dwelling unit complied with the setback requirements in existence at the time of initial construction and was not created by a variance or other procedure;\n(B)\tThe resulting interior side yard setback will not be less than five feet and combined side yard setbacks will not be less than ten feet;\n(C)\tThat portion of the building in the side yard setback shall vertically align with the existing first-story wall.\n(7)\tTownhouses: There is no minimum side yard setback from an interior lot line between one townhouse and an adjoining townhouse.\n(8)\tSetback Relative to Building Height: For buildings subject to the side yard setback requirements based on building height, the setback shall be determined consistent with Figure 7-3.\nFigure 7-3: Setback Relative to Building Height\n(d)\tRear Yard Setbacks: Where a rear yard backs on a street, the rear yard shall have a minimum landscaped setback equal to the minimum front yard landscaped setback from a street for all buildings and uses required for that zone.\n(e)\tOpen Parking Areas, Flagpoles, and Detached Garages and Carports: Open parking areas, flagpoles, and detached garages and carports may be located in compliance with either the required principal building setbacks or accessory building setbacks.\n(f)\tSwimming Pools, Spas, and Hot Tubs: Swimming pools, spas, and hot tubs shall be located according to the applicable accessory structure setbacks on a lot except that pools, spas, or hot tubs may be located in compliance with the required front yard principal building setback.\n(g)\tOil and Gas Operations and Other Uses: Oil and gas operations shall be set back from any residential use, residential zone, school, daycare center, hospital, senior living facility, assisted living facility, outdoor venue, playground, permanent sports field, amphitheater, public park and recreation use, or other similar public outdoor facility, but not including trails or City of Boulder open space, in accordance with the standards of Section 9-6-7(b)(2), B.R.C. 1981.

The city manager shall determine the length and degree of the required access restriction measures for the property.\n(3)\tResidential Access to Arterial and Collector Streets Restricted: No residential structures shall have direct access onto an arterial. However, if no alternative street access is possible, an access may be permitted subject to the incorporation of any design standards determined to be necessary by the city manager to preserve the safety and the traffic-carrying capacity of the arterial or collector.\n(4)\tAccess From Lowest Category Street Required: A property that has frontage on more than one street, alley or public access shall locate its access or curb cut on the lowest category street, alley or public access frontage. If more than one access point or curb cut is necessary, an additional access or curb cut will be permitted only where the proposed access or curb cut satisfies the requirements in this section.\n(5)\tProperty Right to Access: If a property cannot be served by any access point or curb cut that satisfies this section, the city manager will designate the access point or curb cut for the subject property based on optimal traffic safety.\n(6)\tMultiple Access Points for Detached Dwelling Units: The city manager will permit multiple access points on the same street for a single lot containing a detached dwelling unit upon finding that there is at least one hundred linear feet of lot frontage adjacent to the front yard on such street, the area has a limited amount of pedestrian activity because of the low density character, and multiple access points are not inconsistent with the city's plans for curbside use on the street. The total cumulative width of multiple curb cuts shall not exceed the maximum permitted width of a single curb cut. The minimum spacing between multiple curb cuts on the same property shall not be less than sixty-five feet.\n(7)\tShared Driveways for Residential Structures: A lot with a detached dwelling unit that does not have frontage on the street from which access is taken may be served by a shared driveway that meets all of the standards and criteria for shared driveways set forth in the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards.\n(8)\tResidential Driveways: Any driveway or access for a property with a residential use must lead to an off-street parking space meeting the requirements of this title and the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards.\n(9)\tDriveway Width: Driveways shall meet the following standards (see Figure 9-1 of this section):\n(A)\tMinimum driveway width: The width of a driveway leading to an off-street parking space shall not be less than nine feet.

If residential uses comprise more than 50 percent of the floor area, the maximum is one space per 500 square feet of floor area per lot or parcel. This maximum does not apply in a parking district.\n(c)\tGeneral Parking Standards:\n(1)\tADA Requirements: Where off-street parking spaces are provided, accessible parking spaces shall be provided, meeting the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended.\n(2)\tElectric Vehicle Charging Requirements: Where off-street parking spaces are provided, electric vehicle charging spaces shall be provided, meeting the requirements of the City of Boulder Energy Conservation Code.\n(3)\tRounding Rule: For all motor vehicle and bicycle parking space requirements resulting in a fraction, the fraction shall be:\n(A)\tRounded to the next higher whole number when the required number of spaces is five or less; or\n(B)\tRounded to the next lower whole number when the required number of spaces is more than five.\n(4)\tParking Requirements for Lots in Two or More Zoning Districts: For lots that have more than one zoning designation, the required bicycle parking for the use(s) on the lot may be provided on any portion of the lot, subject to the provisions of this title.\n(5)\tApprovals: Any minimum off-street motor vehicle parking requirement, for spaces other than accessible spaces, in any planned development, planned residential development, planned unit development, site review, use review, or other approval has no force and effect and shall not be enforced.\n(d)\tMotor Vehicle Parking Design Standards:\n(1)\tLocation of Open or Enclosed Parking: Open or enclosed parking areas are subject to the following requirements:\n(A)\tNo parking areas shall be located in any required landscaped setback abutting a street. However, in RR, RE, RL, A, or P zoning districts, if a driveway serves as access to at least one parking space that meets the design requirements of this title and that is located outside of the landscaped setback, up to two vehicles may be parked in the driveway within the landscaped setback. The requirements of this subsection may be varied to allow off-street parking to be located within the front yard setback pursuant to the standards and procedures in Section 9-2-3, B.R.C. 1981.\n(B)\tNo parking areas shall be located closer than ten feet from a side yard adjacent to a public street in the BMS and MU-2 zoning districts.\n(2)\tParking Stall Design Standards: Parking stalls shall meet the following standards, based on stall type. The minimum maneuvering area to the rear of any parking stall shall be no less than twenty-four feet except as specified in Table 9-1 below for parking at an angle other than the 90-degree category. If the proposed use anticipates long-term parking as the major parking demand, the city manager may reduce those minimum parking stall sizes.\nTABLE 9-1: STANDARD PARKING DIMENSION STANDARDS\nTABLE 9-2: SMALL CAR PARKING DIMENSION STANDARDS\nFigure 9-2: Parking Dimensions Diagram\n(A)\tStandard Stalls: All off-street standard parking spaces shall meet the minimum size requirements established in Table 9-1 and Figure 9-2 of this section.\n(B)\tSmall Car Stalls:\n(i)\tSmall Car Stalls Allowed: A proportion of the total spaces provided in each parking area may be designed and shall be signed for small car use according to Table 9-3 of this section.\nTABLE 9-3: SMALL CAR STALLS\n(ii)\tDimensional Standards: All small car stalls shall meet the minimum size requirements as indicated in Table 9-2 and Figure 9-2 of this section.\n(C)\tAccessible Parking Stalls:\n(i)\tDimensional Standards: Accessible parking spaces shall be eight feet wide and nineteen feet in length, with the standard width drive lane. Individual spaces shall have an additional five foot-wide, diagonally striped aisle abutting the passenger side of the space. If such spaces are provided in adjacent pairs, then one five-foot aisle may be shared between the two spaces. Accessible parking spaces shall conform to the construction and design standards in the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards and be located to maximize convenience of access to the facility and minimize the need to cross the flow of vehicular traffic. (See Figure 9-3 of this section.)\nFigure 9-3: Accessible Parking Space Design\nAccessible spaces must measure eight feet by nineteen feet and be flanked by a five-foot diagonally-striped aisle. Two adjacent spaces may share a single five-foot aisle. The aisle must be at the same grade as the accessible space and any adjacent sidewalk must slope to meet the grade of the aisle. The slope may not exceed 1:12.\n(ii)\tParking Waiver for Previously Conforming Accessible Parking Spaces: If a previously conforming required accessible parking space was rendered nonstandard by the amendment to Subparagraph (d)(2)(C)(i) of this section which required the five foot aisle, and its owner desires to add such an aisle, and the addition will reduce the available parking below that required for the premises, such owner may apply to the city manager for a parking waiver. The manager shall grant such a waiver insofar as it is necessary and appropriate to permit all required parking spaces for the disabled to be conforming spaces.\n(3)\tDrive Aisles:\n(A)\tThere is a definite and logical system of drive aisles to serve the entire parking area. Drive aisles shall have a minimum eighteen-foot width clearance for two-way traffic and a minimum ten-foot width clearance for one-way traffic unless the city manager finds that the parking stalls to be served require a greater or lesser width. A physical separation or barrier, such as vertical curbs, may be required in order to separate parking areas from the travel lanes. (See Figure 9-4 of this section.)\nFigure 9-4: Drive Aisles\nDrive aisles provide access to parking areas but not to individual spaces. Drive aisles serving two-way traffic must be a minimum of eighteen feet wide. Drive aisles serving one-way traffic must be a minimum of ten feet wide. Raised planters, curbs, or other physical barriers may be necessary to separate parking areas from travel lanes. See Tables 9-1and 9-2 of this section for parking aisle dimensions.\n(B)\tTurnarounds are provided for dead-end parking bays of eight stalls or more. Turnarounds must be identified with a sign or surface graphic and marked \"no parking.\" The use of accessible parking spaces as the required turnaround is not permitted. (See Figure 9-5 of this section.)\nFigure 9-5: Parking Turnaround Spaces\nIn dead-end parking bays with eight or more stalls, a turnaround space must be provided and properly marked.\n(4)\tParking Access:\n(A)\tNo parking stall is located so as to block access by emergency vehicles.\n(B)\tDriveways located in required yards are situated at an angle of approximately ninety degrees to the street to which they connect.\n(5)\tParking Design Details:\n(A)\tIf parking lot lighting is provided, all lighting shall comply with Section 9-9-16, \"Lighting, Outdoor,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(B)\tWith the exception of parking areas for detached dwelling units, all parking areas shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, or other similar permanent, hard surface. Parking areas for detached dwelling units shall be surfaced with materials capable of sustaining the weight and impacts of the associated vehicle usage.\n(C)\tSuitable curbs or barriers to protect public sidewalks and to prevent parking in areas where parking is not permitted are provided, except for parking areas for detached dwelling units.\n(D)\tAll open off-street parking areas with five or more spaces shall be screened from the street and property edges and shall provide interior lot landscaping in accordance with Section 9-9-14, \"Parking Lot Landscaping Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(E)\tDriveways parallel to public sidewalks are separated from such walks by an eight-foot landscaped area or a solid wall at least forty-two inches in height.\n(F)\tWheel or bumper guards are located so that no part of a vehicle extends beyond a parking area boundary line, intrudes on a pedestrian way, or contacts any wall, fence, or planting. A vehicular overhang may, however, intrude into a private pedestrian way located on the perimeter of a parking lot if the pedestrian way is not less than six feet in width. (See Figure 9-6 of this section.)\nFigure 9-6: Permitted Vehicular Overhang\n(G)\tWithin the DT zoning districts, at-grade parking is not permitted within thirty feet of a street right-of-way unless approved as part of a site review approval under Section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term \"street\" does not include \"alley.\"\n(e)\tBicycle Parking:\n(1)\tRequired Bicycle Spaces: Bicycle parking spaces must be provided as required by Table 9-4 of this section. Where more than 10 spaces are required, at least five percent of the required bicycle parking spaces shall be designed to accommodate and signed for larger bikes with dimensions of at least 10 feet of length and 3 feet of width.\nTABLE 9-4: OFF-STREET BICYCLE PARKING REQUIREMENTS\n(2)\tBicycle Facilities: Both bicycle lockers and racks shall:\n(A)\tProvide for storage and locking of bicycles, either in lockers, medium-security racks, or an equivalent installation in which both the bicycle frame and the wheels may be locked by the user.\n(B)\tBe designed so as not to cause damage to the bicycle.\n(C)\tFacilitate easy locking without interference from or to adjacent bicycles.\n(D)\tBe anchored with tamper-resistant anchors so that they cannot be easily removed.\n(E)\tBe of solid construction, resistant to rust, corrosion, hammers, grinders, saws, and other tools.\n(F)\tBe consistent with their environment in color and design and be incorporated whenever possible into building or street furniture design.\n(G)\tBe located in convenient, highly visible, active, well-lighted areas.\n(H)\tBe located so that they do not interfere with pedestrian movements.\n(I)\tBe identified by wayfinding signs if the bicycle parking area is not visible from the site or building entrance.\n(3)\tShort-Term Bicycle Parking: Short-term bicycle parking is intended to offer a convenient and accessible area to park bicycles for customers and other visitors. Short-term bicycle parking shall be located:\n(A)\tOn the public access level;\n(B)\tWithin fifty feet of the main building entrances;\n(C)\tOutside the building; and\n(D)\tIn an area that allows for passive surveillance, such as in front of business windows and in high-traffic areas.\n(4)\tLong-Term Bicycle Parking: Long-term bicycle parking offers a secure and weather-protected place to park bicycles for employees, residents, commuters, and other visitors who generally stay at a site for several hours.

It is the purpose of this section to regulate structures and vegetation on property, including City-owned and controlled property, to the extent necessary to ensure access to solar energy, by reasonably regulating the interests of neighboring property holders within the City.\n(b)\tApplicability of Section:\n(1)\tPrivate Property: All private property is subject to this section.\n(2)\tDevelopment Approval: No proposed development permit may be approved for any structure that would violate the basic solar access provided by this section unless the object or structure is exempt or an exception is granted by the city manager or the BOZA for such purpose.\n(3)\tGovernment Property: Governmental organizations not under the jurisdiction of the City may elect to enjoy the benefits of solar access under this section if they also consent in a written agreement with the City to be bound by its restrictions.\n(4)\tCity Property: Property owned or possessed by the City is subject to, and enjoys the benefits of this section. The City may submit applications, make objections and take actions that are afforded to any other person subject to the provisions of this section.\n(c)\tSolar Access Areas Established: Three solar access areas are hereby established: SA Area I, SA Area II and SA Area III. The purpose of dividing the City into solar access areas is to provide maximum solar access protection for each area of the City consistent with planned densities, topography and lot configurations and orientations.\n(1)\tSolar Access Area I (RR-1, RR-2, RE, RL-1 and MH): SA Area I is designed to protect solar access principally for south yards, south walls and rooftops in areas where, because of planned density, topography or lot configurations or orientations, the preponderance of lots therein currently enjoy such access and where solar access of this nature would not unduly restrict permissible development. SA Area I includes all property in RR-1, RR-2, RE, RL-1 and MH zoning districts.\n(2)\tSolar Access Area II (RL-2, RM, MU-1, MU-3, RMX, RH-1, RH-2, RH-3, RH-4, RH-5 and I): SA Area II is designed to protect solar access principally for rooftops in areas where, because of planned density, topography or lot configuration or orientation, the preponderance of lots therein currently enjoy such access and where solar access of this nature would not unduly restrict permissible development. SA Area II includes all property in RL-2, RM, MU-1, MU-3, RMX, RH-1, RH-2, RH-3, RH-4, RH-5 and I zoning districts.\n(3)\tSolar Access Area III - Permits - Other Zoning Districts: SA Area III includes areas where, because of planned densities, topography or lot configurations or orientations, uniform solar access protection for south yards and walls or for rooftops may unduly restrict permissible development. Solar access protection in SA Area III is provided through permits. SA Area III initially includes property in all zoning districts other than those set forth in Paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.\n(d)\tBasic Solar Access Protection:\n(1)\tSolar Fence: A solar fence is hereby hypothesized for each lot located in SA Area I and SA Area II. Each solar fence completely encloses the lot in question, and its foundation is contiguous with the lot lines. Such fence is vertical, is opaque and lacks any thickness.\n(A)\tSA Area I: No person shall erect an object or structure on any other lot that would shade a protected lot in SA Area I to a greater degree than the lot would be shaded by a solar fence twelve feet in height, between two hours before and two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day.\n(B)\tSA Area II: No person shall erect an object or structure on any other lot that would shade a protected lot in SA Area II to a greater degree than the lot would be shaded by a solar fence twenty-five feet in height, between two hours before and two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day.\n(C)\tSA Area III: Solar fences are not hypothesized for lots located in SA Area III. Solar access protection in SA Area III is available under this section only through permits, as hereinafter provided.\n(D)\tAdjoining Duplex or Townhouse Lots in All Solar Areas: On duplex or townhouse lots, solar fences are not hypothesized on interior lot lines between adjoining units of a duplex or adjoining townhouses. Other lot lines are subject to the solar fence restrictions of subsection (A), (B), or (C), as applicable.\n(2)\tHeight: Unless prohibited by another section of this title, nothing in this section prevents a structure in SA Area III from being erected up to a height of thirty-five feet if located within the allowed building envelope. However, unless an exception is granted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, no such structure may exceed thirty-five feet in height if any such excess height would cause the structure to violate, or to increase the degree of violation of, the basic solar access protection provided for any lot in SA Area I or SA Area II.\n(A)\tNothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the principal building on a lot in SA Area I or II from being erected within the building envelope up to the height of the solar fence in the area in which the structure is located.\n(B)\tEach application for a development permit for a building of a height greater than allowed by this subsection shall:\n(i)\tInclude a graphic representation showing the shadows that would be cast by the proposed structure between two hours before and two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day;\n(ii)\tThe solar fences on all lots that the shadows would touch;\n(iii)\tAll possible obstructions of solar access protected by permit; and\n(iv)\tProvide additional information as may be required by the city manager.\n(3)\tInsubstantial Breaches and Existing Structures: Insubstantial breaches of the basic solar access protection or of the protection provided by a solar access permit are exempt from the application of this section. A structure in existence on the date of establishment of an applicable solar access area, or structures and vegetation in existence on the date of issuance of an applicable solar access permit, are exempt from the application of this section. For purposes of this section, structures are deemed to be in existence on the date of issuance of a development permit authorizing its construction.\n(4)\tTemporary Solar Obstructions: Unavoidable temporary obstructions of protected solar access necessitated by construction activities or other necessary and lawful purposes are exempt to the extent that they do not exceed ten days in any three month period and thirty days in any year.\n(5)\tSolar Analysis: When a solar analysis is required for any review process, it shall be prepared in compliance with the methods described in materials provided by the city manager.\n(e)\tAmendment of Solar Access Areas:\n(1)\tPurpose: The planning board may amend solar access areas on its own motion or on petition of any person with a property interest in the subject area. A petitioner shall submit a list to the planning board of the names and addresses of all owners of property within and adjacent to the subject area and within one hundred feet to the north and sixty feet to the east and west of the subject area.\n(2)\tPublic Hearing and Notice Required: Before amending a solar access area, the planning board shall conduct a public hearing on the proposal. The board shall provide notice for the hearing pursuant to the requirements of Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tReview Criteria: A solar access area may be amended only after the planning board determines that one or more of the following conditions applies to the subject area:\n(A)\tThe subject area was established as a particular solar access area in error, and as currently established it is inconsistent with the purposes of the solar access areas;\n(B)\tPermissible land uses and densities in the subject area are changing or should change to such a degree that it is in the public interest to amend the solar access area for the area; or\n(C)\tExperience with application of this ordinance has demonstrated that:\n(i)\tThe level of solar access protection available in the subject area can be increased without significant interference with surrounding property; or\n(ii)\tApplication of the ordinance has unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment of real property in the subject area.\n(4)\tImpact of Changes: When any area is amended from SA Area I to another solar access area or from SA Area II to SA Area III, any solar access beneficiary whose solar access is affected by such change may apply for a permit to provide solar access protection to any solar energy system installed and in use on the date the change becomes effective.\n(f)\tExceptions:\n(1)\tPurpose: Any person desiring to erect an object or structure or increase or add to any object or structure, in such a manner as to interfere with the basic solar access protection, may apply for an exception.\n(2)\tApplication Requirements: An applicant for an exception shall pay the application fee prescribed by Subsection 4-20-33(b), B.R.C. 1981, and apply on a form furnished by the city manager that includes, without limitation:\n(A)\tThe applicant's name and address, the owner's name and address, and a legal description of the lot for which an exception is sought;\n(B)\tSurvey plats or other accurate drawings showing lot lines, structures, solar systems, dimensions and topography as necessary to establish the reduction of basic solar access protection expected on each lot that would be affected by the exception, together with a graphic representation of the shadows that would be cast by the proposed structure during the period from two hours before to two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day. The requirements of this subparagraph may be modified by the city manager, depending upon the nature of the exception sought;\n(C)\tA list of all lots that may be affected by the exception, including the names and addresses of all owners of such lots;\n(D)\tA statement and supporting information describing the reasons that less intrusive alternatives, if any, to the action that would be allowed by the exception cannot or should not be implemented; and\n(E)\tA statement certifying that the proposed structure would not obstruct solar access protected by permit.\n(3)\tPublic Notice: The city manager shall provide public notice pursuant to Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(4)\tCity Manager Action: The city manager may grant an exception of this section following the public notification period if:\n(A)\tThe applicant presents the manager with an affidavit of each owner of each affected lot declaring that such owner is familiar with the application and the effect the exception would have on the owner's lot, and that the owner has no objection to the granting of the exception, and\n(B)\tThe manager determines that the application complies with the requirements in Paragraph (f)(2) of this section, and\n(C)\tThe manager finds that each of the requirements of Paragraph (f)(6) of this section has been met.\n(5)\tReferral or Appeal of City Manager's Decision: The city manager may refer the application or the city manager's decision may be appealed by the applicant to the BOZA pursuant to the procedures of Section 9-4-4, \"Appeals, Call-Ups and Public Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981. If an affidavit from each owner of each affected lot per subparagraph (f)(4)(A) cannot be obtained, the applicant may apply for consideration of the exception before the BOZA. Public notification of the hearing shall be provided pursuant to Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981. The sign posted shall remain posted until the conclusion of the hearing.\n(6)\tReview Criteria: In order to grant an exception, the approving authority must find that each of the following requirements has been met:\n(A)\tBecause of basic solar access protection requirements and the land use regulations:\n(i)\tReasonable use cannot otherwise be made of the lot for which the exception is requested; or\n(ii)\tThe part of the adjoining lot or lots that the proposed structure would shade is inherently unsuitable as a site for a solar energy system; or\n(iii)\tAny shading would not significantly reduce the solar potential of the protected lot; and\n(iv)\tSuch situations have not been created by the applicant;\n(B)\tExcept for actions under Subparagraphs (f)(6)(D), (f)(6)(E), and (f)(6)(F) of this section, the exception would be the minimal action that would afford relief in an economically feasible manner;\n(C)\tThe exception would cause the least interference possible with basic solar access protection for other lots;\n(D)\tIf the proposed structure is located in a historic district designated by the city council according to Section 9-11-2, \"City Council May Designate or Amend Landmarks and Historic Districts,\" B.R.C. 1981, and if it conformed with the requirements of this section, its roof design would be incompatible with the character of the development in the historic district;\n(E)\tIf part of a proposed roof which is to be reconstructed or added to would be incompatible with the design of the remaining parts of the existing roof so as to detract materially from the character of the structure, provided that the roof otherwise conformed with the requirements of this section;\n(F)\tIf the proposed interference with basic solar access protection would be due to a solar energy system to be installed, such system could not be feasibly located elsewhere on the applicant's lot;\n(G)\tIf an existing solar system would be shaded as a result of the exception, the beneficiary of that system would nevertheless still be able to make reasonable use of it for its intended purpose;\n(H)\tThe exception would not cause more than an insubstantial breach of solar access protected by permit as defined in Paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and\n(I)\tAll other requirements for the issuance of an exception have been met. The applicant bears the burden of proof with respect to all issues of fact.\n(7)\tConditions of Approval: The approving authority may grant exceptions subject to such terms and conditions as the authority finds just and equitable to assist persons whose protected solar access is diminished by the exception. Such terms and conditions may include a requirement that the applicant for an exception take actions to remove obstructions or otherwise increase solar access for any person whose protected solar access is adversely affected by granting the exception.\n(8)\tPlanning Board: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection, if the applicant has a development application submitted for review that is to be heard by the planning board and that would require an exception, the planning board shall act in place of the BOZA, with authority to grant exceptions concurrent with other actions on the application, pursuant to the procedures and criteria of this section.\n(g)\tSolar Siting:\n(1)\tSiting Requirements: For purposes of insuring the potential for utilization of solar energy in the city, all planned unit developments and subdivisions shall be designed and constructed in compliance with the following solar siting requirements:\n(A)\tAll residential units in Solar Access Areas I, II, and III have a roof surface that meets all of the following criteria:\n(i)\tIs oriented within thirty degrees of a true east-west direction;\n(ii)\tIs flat or not sloped towards true north;\n(iii)\tIs physically and structurally capable of supporting at least seventy-five square feet of un-shaded solar collectors for each individual dwelling unit in the building; and\n(iv)\tHas unimpeded solar access under either the provisions of this section or through easements, covenants, or other private agreements among affected landowners that the city manager finds are adequate to protect continued solar access for such roof surface;\n(B)\tEach residential unit in Solar Access Area I has an exterior wall surface that meets all of the following criteria:\n(i)\tIs oriented within thirty degrees of a true east-west direction;\n(ii)\tIs located on the southernmost side of the unit; and\n(iii)\tIs immediately adjacent to a heated space;\n(C)\tEach nonresidential building with an anticipated hot water demand of one thousand or more gallons a day has a roof surface that meets all of the following criteria:\n(i)\tIs flat or oriented within thirty degrees of a true east-west direction;\n(ii)\tIs physically and structurally capable of supporting a solar collector or collectors capable of providing at least one-half of the anticipated hot water needs of the building; and\n(iii)\tHas unimpeded solar access under either the provisions of this section or through easements, covenants, or other private agreements among affected landowners that the city manager finds are adequate to protect continued solar access for such roof surface;\n(2)\tWaivers: Upon request of any applicant for a building permit or a subdivision or planned unit development approval, the approving authority may waive such of the requirements of this paragraph as it deems appropriate if it finds that any of the following criteria are met:\n(A)\tAny structure or structures subject to the requirements of this paragraph are designed and intended to be unheated;\n(B)\tTopographic features, land slope, shading by objects, structures, or vegetation outside the control of the applicant, or the nature of surrounding development or circulation patterns when combined with the requirements of this paragraph:\n(i)\tMakes use of solar energy not feasible in some or all of the structures to be erected;\n(ii)\tWill result in a substantial decrease in the density of land use in the subdivision or planned unit development;\n(iii)\tWill result in an increase in transportation or other energy use that substantially outweighs the potential for increased solar energy use created by adherence to these requirements; or\n(iv)\tWill be inconsistent with the floodplain management requirements of Section 9-3-2, \"Floodplains,\" B.R.C. 1981;\n(C)\tSubstantial planning, design, or other preliminary expenditures have been incurred by the applicant prior to July 1, 1982, and adherence to the standards of this paragraph would work an undue hardship on the applicant;\n(h)\tSolar Access Permits:\n(1)\tPurpose of Solar Access Permit: In order to promote opportunities for the use of solar energy and where basic solar access protection established by this section is inadequate to protect potential solar energy users, or to insure maximum utilization of solar energy resources consistent with reasonable use of surrounding property, persons may obtain permits under this section. Beneficial use is the limit and measure of any right conferred by permit and no permit shall restrict use of other property beyond the extent reasonable to insure efficient and economical beneficial use of solar energy by the permittee. Further, no permit shall restrict the reasonable use and enjoyment of adjacent properties.\n(2)\tEligibility Standards: Any owner or possessor of property who has installed a solar energy system or who intends to install such a system within a year from the date of application may apply for a permit if:\n(A)\tThe lot for which a permit is requested is included in SA Area III;\n(B)\tThe system that has been or will be installed is capable of applying to beneficial use substantial amounts of solar energy outside the hours of the day during which basic protection is provided for under this section;\n(C)\tA solar energy system is in existence on the lot or is planned to be built within a year and the lot is changed from SA Area I to another solar access area or is changed from SA Area II to SA AREA III, resulting in a diminution or elimination of protection previously afforded the user or potential user of the solar energy system;\n(D)\tA new structure is built on a lot in SA Area I or SA Area II after the effective date of this section whose location renders the basic solar access protection inadequate, and the structure could not reasonably have been constructed at a location where it would have substantially benefited from the basic solar access protection provided by this section; or\n(E)\tThe applicant demonstrates that there are substantial technical, legal, or economic factors that render it infeasible to collect a reasonable amount of solar energy by utilizing the basic solar access protection available under this section without a permit. Such factors include, without limitation, structural characteristics of the applicant's building that limit possibilities for economical retrofit of a solar energy system or shading by objects, structures, or vegetation that are beyond the applicant's control and are exempt from the requirements of this section.\n(3)\tApplication Requirements: An applicant for a permit shall pay the fee prescribed by Subsection 4-20-33(a), B.R.C. 1981, and complete an application in writing on a form furnished by the city manager that includes, without limitation:\n(A)\tThe applicant's name and address, the owner's name and address, and a legal description of the lot where the solar energy system is located or will be located;\n(B)\tA statement by the applicant that the solar energy system is already installed or that the applicant intends to install such a system on the lot within one year of the issuance of the permit;\n(C)\tA description of the existing or proposed size and location of the system, its orientation with respect to south, and its elevation and orientation from the horizontal;\n(D)\tA statement describing the beneficial use to which solar energy is or will be applied and certifying the energy capacity of the system in BTUs or BTU equivalents and its reasonable life expectancy;\n(E)\tA statement and accurate drawings describing the access protection desired beyond the basic solar access protection provided by this section, specifying the hours of the day, seasons of the year, and locations on the applicant's lot for which protection is desired;\n(F)\tA description of all existing vegetation, objects, and structures wherever located that will or may in the future shade the solar energy system, together with a map or drawing showing their location to the extent possible;\n(G)\tInformation showing that the applicant has done everything reasonable in designing and locating the system so as to minimize the impact it will have on use and development on nearby land;\n(H)\tSurvey plats or other accurate drawings showing lot lines, dimensions, and topography of the lot on which the solar energy system is or will be located and all surrounding properties that are intended to be subject to the permit; and\n(I)\tA list of all lots that may be affected by the permit, including the names and addresses of all owners of such lots.\n(4)\tPublic Notice: The city manager shall provide public notification pursuant to the requirements of Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(5)\tPermit Issuance: The city manager shall issue a solar access permit and may impose additional conditions or restrictions as the manager deems appropriate if the application complies with the requirements of Paragraph (h)(7) of this section.\n(6)\tAppeal of City Manager's Decision: The city manager's decision may be appealed to the BOZA pursuant to the procedures of Section 9-4-4, \"Appeals, Call-Ups and Public Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981. Public notification of the hearing shall be provided pursuant to Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(7)\tPermit Requirements: In order to issue a permit, the approving authority must find that each of the following requirements has been met:\n(A)\tThe applicant meets at least one of the eligibility standards of Paragraph (h)(2) of this section;\n(B)\tThe applicant has done everything reasonable in designing and locating the proposed solar energy system to minimize the impact it will have on use and development of nearby land. However, the fact that an alternate design or site may be more expensive does not necessarily establish that the applicant's failure to select that alternate design or site is reasonable. In making this finding, the board or the city manager may consider whether the additional cost of alternative, less intrusive sites or solar energy systems, if any, would exceed the difference between the adverse effects, if any, imposed on other lots by the proposed site and solar energy system and the adverse effects, if any, that would be imposed on other lots by alternative sites or solar energy systems;\n(C)\tIssuance of the permit is consistent with reasonable use and enjoyment of nearby land, excluding landscaping considerations. Issuance of the permit will be presumed not to be consistent with reasonable use and enjoyment of nearby land if issuance would prevent any affected property owner from erecting, consistent with legal requirements, a structure of a size, character and usefulness reasonably typical of those in existence on similar lots subject to the same zoning requirements located within one-fifth mile of the lot in question. However, nothing in this subsection prohibits issuance of a permit only because it would impose requirements on a neighboring lot owner that are more restrictive than the height or setback requirements that would otherwise apply, if reasonable use and enjoyment of such lot is preserved; and\n(D)\tIssuance of the permit is consistent with reasonable landscaping of nearby land. In determining consistency, the board shall consider the need for any additional landscaping in the future, including any energy conservation value that such landscaping may have.\n(8)\tConditions of Approval: The board may grant permits subject to such terms and conditions as it finds just and equitable.\n(9)\tRecords: The city manager shall maintain complete records of all permits that have been issued and shall make them readily available for public inspection.\n(10)\tExpiration of Permit: A solar access permit expires if:\n(A)\tA functioning system is not installed within a year after the issuance of the permit;\n(B)\tThe solar energy system protected by the permit has not functioned to fulfill its intended purpose for a continuous period of two or more years; or\n(C)\tThe term established under Paragraph (h)(11) of this section expires.\n(11)\tTerm of Solar Energy System: The city manager or the BOZA shall specify the term of each solar access permit, which shall be for the reasonable life expectancy of the particular solar energy system, as determined by the manager or the board. At the expiration of a permit, it may be renewed in the same manner as new permits are issued.\n(12)\tRenewal of Permit: If no functioning solar energy system is installed within a year of the issuance of the permit, the city manager may grant a renewal of up to one additional year to the holder of the expired permit if the permittee demonstrates that the permittee has exercised due diligence in attempting to install the system.\n(13)\tEnforcement: A solar access permit is enforceable by the beneficiary if, and only if, the beneficiary has properly recorded the permit in the real property records of the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder with respect to each affected lot in such a manner that it could be detected through a customary title search.\n(A)\tOn sale, lease or transfer of the lot on which the protected solar system is located, the right to enforce its terms passes to the beneficial user of the system.\n(B)\tNo property owner shall be requested to remedy vegetative shading unless a protected solar system is installed and functioning.\n(14)\tImpacts of Vegetation on an Issued Permit: Upon application of a beneficiary to the BOZA, vegetative shading may be remedied to the extent necessary to comply with the terms specified in a solar access permit. However, no vegetation in the ground and growing at the time the permit application is filed may be ordered removed or trimmed. After notice to at least the beneficiary and the vegetation owner, the board shall hold a hearing and, based on evidence submitted by any interested party, may issue any necessary order and specify the time in which actions thereunder must be performed. Absent unusual circumstances, the cost of remedying shading from vegetation not in the ground and growing at the time the permit application is filed shall be borne by the vegetation owner. If an owner or possessor of real property who receives an order to remedy vegetative shading fails to comply within the specified time, the city manager may order the condition remedied and charge the actual cost thereof to the person to whom the order is directed, who shall pay the bill. If any person fails or refuses to pay when due any charge imposed under this subsection, the manager may, in addition to taking other collection remedies, certify due and unpaid charges to the Boulder County Treasurer for collection as provided in Section 2-2-12, \"City Manager May Certify Taxes, Charges and Assessments to County Treasurer for Collection,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(i)\tAuthority to Issue Regulations: The city manager and the BOZA are each authorized to adopt rules and regulations necessary in order to interpret or implement the provisions of this section that each administers.\nOrdinance Nos. 7484 (2006); 7522 (2007); 7535 (2007); 7568 (2007); 7655 (2009); 7878 (2012); 8409 (2020); 8622 (2024)"

It applies only to signs which are visible beyond the boundaries of the property upon which they are located. There are two exceptions to this rule which are most conveniently included in this section: signs erected on private property as part of a sign program which was a condition of approval of development under this title; and signs on private vehicles located on public property. This section does not apply to a sign carried by a person, whether on public or private property. This section does not apply to signs, other than those on vehicles, on public property.\n(2)\tIntent: The purpose of this section is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city by regulating the design, construction, and installation of private signs in the city. The city council recognizes that signs are necessary means of visual communication for the public convenience and that businesses and individuals have the right to identify themselves and convey messages by using signs that are accessory and incidental to the use on the premises where the signs are located. In this section the council intends to provide a reasonable balance between the right of a business or an individual to identify itself and to convey its message and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord that results from the unrestricted proliferation of signs, especially off-premises billboards. The ability to convey messages by signs is important to the proper and efficient functioning of society. However, the natural desire to speak more \"loudly\" through signs which are more numerous, larger, higher, and closer to the street than the signs used by one's neighbors and competitors requires a set of rules applicable to all similarly situated. With a level playing field the community as a whole benefits and no individual is disadvantaged in communicating. The council also intends by this section to ensure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community and that the value of nearby property and the economic health of the community as a whole are protected from visual blight. Another purpose of this section is to protect the public from hazardous conditions by prohibiting signs that: are structurally unsafe, particularly in light of the unique wind hazards in the city, obscure or distract the vision of motorists, or compete or conflict with necessary traffic signs and warning signals. In adopting this section, the council recognizes that the size of signs that provide adequate identification in pedestrian-oriented areas differs from that necessary in vehicular-oriented areas where traffic is heavy, travel speeds are greater, and required setbacks are greater.\n(A)\tThe city council recognizes that since the sign code was originally enacted in 1971, most nonconforming signs have been eliminated through attrition and through the amortization provision of chapter 48 of the Revised Code of the City of Boulder, Colorado 1965. But nonconforming signs may enter the city as it annexes developed land, and code changes may make conforming signs nonconforming. The council recognizes that permitting the continuation of such nonconforming signs provides an unfair competitive advantage over persons whose signs conform to the section requirements and intends that signs that do not conform with this section be eliminated as expeditiously as practicable to protect the public safety and welfare and the visual environment.\n(B)\tThe city council recognizes the right of residents of the city to fully exercise their right to free speech by the use of signs containing noncommercial messages that are subject to minimum regulations regarding size, number, structural safety and visual setbacks.\n(C)\tThe city council finds that certain types of signs are not appropriate for regulation by permit under this section because they:\n(i)\tWould not create a structural safety or traffic safety hazard;\n(ii)\tWould promote public safety or the dissemination of public information;\n(iii)\tWould not give rise to aesthetic or traffic concerns;\n(iv)\tIn the case of art, are deemed a privilege of individual creative expression;\n(v)\tIn the case of other noncommercial signs, are accessory to the exercise of first amendment rights;\n(vi)\tWith respect to permitted private traffic signs, the council finds that such signs serve a compelling governmental interest in the safe movement of traffic in private parking lots and drives and serve a function which cannot effectively be served in any other manner;\n(vii)\tWith respect to signs required by law, the council finds that the law requiring the sign is sufficient regulation of the sign, and that it is inappropriate for the government to require a sign to be posted but count it against allowable private signage, and that such signs by definition serve a compelling governmental interest in a site-specific manner which cannot otherwise be served as effectively;\n(viii)\tWith respect to permitted utility warning signs, the council finds that the dispersed nature of utility lines throughout all the community does not lend itself to the property by property regulation otherwise used in this code, and that warning of the location of utilities and of their hazards so that persons will not be injured thereby, so that fire, police, and other public emergency services may be conducted expeditiously and safely, and so that the essential public functions served by such utilities will not be impaired constitutes a compelling governmental interest and requires a different form of regulation;\n(ix)\tWith respect to permitted vehicular signs, the council finds that regulation of bumper stickers and other forms of personal expression is inappropriate in a free and highly mobile society and that such signs are ordinarily small, whereas regulation of commercial signs on motor vehicles, which the council finds are often large, is appropriate for those who have chosen to engage in commerce within the City and serves a substantial governmental interest in aesthetics and traffic safety;\n(x)\tWith respect to permitted window signs, the council finds that such signs present no structural hazards and provide a method by which messages may be displayed on short notice by the property owner or tenant as that person perceives the need to communicate without need for any government role in the protection of the broader public interest, and that within the limitations given have not and will not cause aesthetic blight or traffic hazards of the sort unacceptable to the community; and\n(xi)\tWith respect to signs on bicycles, the council finds that the use of signs on bicycles will not cause aesthetic blight or traffic hazards of the sort unacceptable to the community and will service a substantial governmental interest by reducing the cost of an environmentally beneficial transportation option that will relieve vehicular congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve public health by providing opportunities for exercise; and\n(D)\tCouncil finds that commercial signs towed over the City by aircraft are a distraction to motorists, pedestrians, and other users of the public streets and ways, and impair traffic safety, and constitute unfair competition for earthbound advertisers who comply with the City's sign code when made by multiple passes over the City, and therefore are detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the City, and urges the Federal Aviation Administration to place suitable restrictions upon any certificate of waiver to prohibit towing such signs over the City.\n(b)\tProhibitions and Prohibited Signs:\n(1)\tConformity With Sign Code Required: No person shall display, construct, erect, alter, use, or maintain any sign in the City except in conformance with the provisions of this section.

If a side of a residential building is closer than thirty feet to the public sidewalk, or thirty-five feet to the curb or outer edge of the roadway if there is no such sidewalk, then that area within five feet of such building side shall be excluded from the restrictions of subparagraph (d)(9)(B) of this section, if applicable.\n(D)\tReference in this paragraph to sidewalks, curbs, and roadway edges does not authorize placement of signs off premises on public property or in the public right-of-way.\n(10)\tProjecting: A projecting sign shall comply with the following conditions:\n(A)\tSigns projecting over public property may not project more than thirty-six inches from a wall of a building, and the maximum permissible total area for such a sign is the lesser of:\n(i)\tOne square foot of sign area for each linear foot of frontage of the building upon which such sign is displayed; or\n(ii)\tEighteen square feet per sign, with no face of the sign exceeding nine square feet.\n(B)\tSigns projecting over private property may not project more than six feet from a wall of a building nor beyond the minimum required building setback line and may not exceed twenty-four square feet in total area, and no face of a sign shall exceed twelve square feet.\n(C)\tProjecting signs must have a minimum clearance above the sidewalk of eight feet and may not extend twelve feet or more above the sidewalk nor above the roof line.\n(D)\tAny end panel on a projecting sign is considered a face of the sign and included in the area of that sign if the end panel is twelve inches or more in width.\n(E)\tNo more than one projecting sign may be maintained per tenant space frontage at the ground level of a building. The minimum horizontal distance between projecting signs on a building shall be twenty-five feet.\n(11)\tRoof: A sign may be erected upon or against the side of a roof having an angle of forty-five degrees or more from the horizontal, but must be architecturally integrated with the building and roof by a dormer or similar feature. Such a sign is a wall sign and must comply with the provisions of paragraph (d)(14) of this section concerning wall signs, and must not project more than a total of fifteen inches horizontally, measured at the bottom of the sign, from the side of the roof upon which it is displayed.\n(12)\tSubdivision: In addition to other such signs that may be allowed, signs erected at the time of subdivision of a property in any zoning district may be issued a sign permit if they comply with the following:\n(A)\tA freestanding, wall, or window subdivision sign not exceeding thirty-two square feet in total area and sixteen square feet per face, not exceeding seven feet in height, and set back at least ten feet from any public right-of-way, with no riders or attachments;\n(B)\tDisplayed only on the subdivision for which a subdivision plan has been filed, no more than one such sign per street frontage, and with a minimum distance between such signs in a single subdivision or property of one thousand feet;\n(C)\tDisplayed on or after the date of filing of the subdivision plan and removed within two years from the date of issuance of the first building permit in the subdivision or within thirty days from the time that seventy-five percent of the properties or dwellings in the subdivision or filing thereof have been sold, whichever is sooner.\n(13)\tSuspended: A suspended sign may not exceed ten square feet in total area or five square feet per face; may not project beyond the outside limits of the architectural projection to which it is attached; and shall have a minimum clearance above the sidewalk of eight feet. The minimum permissible horizontal distance between suspended signs is fifteen feet.\n(14)\tWall: A wall sign shall comply with the following conditions:\n(A)\tThe total area of all wall signs on a face of a building may not exceed fifteen percent of the area of that portion of the building face between ground level and the roof line or a line twenty-five feet above grade level, whichever is less.\n(B)\tThe total area of all wall signs on an architecturally distinct wall, where two or more such walls form a face of a building, shall not exceed twenty-five percent of such wall.\n(C)\tNo part of a wall sign may be located more than twenty-five feet above grade level.\n(D)\tNo wall sign may be attached to or displayed against any parapet wall that does not extend around the entire perimeter of the roof enclosed by the parapet. No sign on such a parapet wall may extend more than twenty-four inches above the roof elevation immediately behind the sign, unless approved as part of a site review under section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(E)\tNo wall sign may extend above the roof line of a building except as permitted on a parapet wall. No wall sign may be displayed on the wall of a mechanical room or penthouse or other such enclosed space which is not habitable by the occupants of the building.\n(F)\tThe length of a wall sign shall not exceed seventy percent of the length of the wall or the width of the leased space of the wall on which it is located, whichever is less.\n(G)\tThe lettering height for wall signs located within two hundred fifty feet of the right-of-way of Foothills Parkway (Colorado State Highway 157) or Pearl Parkway east of Foothills Parkway, and visible from such parkway, shall not exceed twenty-four inches.\n(H)\tThe lettering height for wall signs located within the B.V.R.C. and the BMS, MU-3, DT, and BT-2 zoning districts shall not exceed twenty-four inches for single lines of copy and a total of thirty-two inches for multiple lines of copy, and any graphic symbol may not exceed thirty inches in height.\n(I)\tA string of lights which extends on or around the perimeter of a window is subject to the following conditions: the linear length of a string of lights counts as fifty percent of the allowable square footage for wall signs. The maximum linear length of all strings of lights in windows cannot exceed ninety feet.\n(e)\tLimitations on Area, Number, and Height of Signs by Use Module:\n(1)\tUse Modules: The use modules set forth in section 9-6-1, \"Schedule of Permitted Land Uses,\" B.R.C. 1981, apply to this section, and the boundaries of such districts are determined by reference to the zoning map of the city and to interpretation of such map under section 9-5-3, \"Zoning Map,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(2)\tMaximum Sign Area Permitted: The maximum sign area permitted per property, maximum area per sign face, maximum number of signs, and maximum height of freestanding signs in the use modules in the city are as in Table 9-9 of this section, except as modified by other provisions of this section.\nTABLE 9-9: LIMITATIONS ON AREA, NUMBER, AND HEIGHT OF SIGNS BY USE MODULE\n(f)\tComputation of Signs and Sign Area:\n(1)\tRegular Shape: In computing the area of a sign, this section shall be administered using standard mathematical formulas for regular geometric shapes, including, without limitation, triangles, parallelograms, circles, ellipses, or combinations thereof.\n(2)\tIrregular Shape: In the case of an irregularly shaped sign or a sign with letters or symbols directly affixed to or painted on the wall of a building, the area of the sign is the entire area within a single continuous rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight straight lines enclosing the extreme limits of any writing, representation, emblem, or any figure of similar character, together with any material or color forming an integral part or background of the display if used to differentiate such sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but if a freestanding sign structure is not a fence which functions as such, the sign area shall be the area of the entire structure.\n(3)\tSign Structures: In computing the area of a sign, the portion of the sign structure to be included is that which is visible and viewed in the same plane as the sign face and which is made a part of the background of the display.\n(4)\tMore Than One Element: The total surface area of signs composed of more than one sign element includes the vertical and horizontal spacing between each element of the sign.\n(5)\tThree-Dimensional: For three-dimensional figure signs, the sign area is the total area, projected on a vertical plane, of each side of the sign that is visible beyond the boundaries of the property upon which the figure is located. For purposes of this paragraph, a figure is considered to have a side for each ninety degrees or part thereof of visibility from a public right-of-way.\n(6)\tAttachments: Any temporary or permanent rider or attachment to a sign or sign structure is included as part of the total sign area for the sign to which it is attached.\n(7)\tTwo Faces: A sign is computed as having two display faces if the angle between two faces is equal to or less than sixty degrees. If a sign has two or more display faces, the area of all faces and all noncontiguous surfaces is included in determining the sign area.\n(8)\tNumber of Signs: For the purpose of determining the number of signs that may be subject to the provisions of this section, a sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements clearly organized, related, and composed to form a unit. Where elements are displayed in a random manner without an organized relationship of elements or where there is reasonable doubt about the relationship of elements, each element shall be considered to be a single sign.\n(9)\tOne Use of Building Frontage: Building frontage used as the basis of determining permitted sign area for one use may not be used again as the basis for determining the permitted sign area for another use, but nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the additional use from erecting a sign that would otherwise be authorized by the provisions of this section.\n(10)\tMore Than One Frontage: For the purpose of determining the total allowable sign area for buildings with more than one frontage, the following criteria apply:\n(A)\tIf a building has more than one frontage, the maximum sign area for the building is based on the total horizontal length of not more than two contiguous frontages; and\n(B)\tSigns may be located on any side of the building, but the total sign area on any one side of the building may not exceed the area permitted on the basis of that frontage considered independently of other frontages.\n(g)\tPermits and Applications:\n(1)\tThe owner or tenant of property on which a sign is to be located or an authorized agent thereof or a sign contractor licensed by the city shall apply for a sign permit in writing on a form furnished by the city manager, shall sign the application, and shall pay the fee prescribed in section 4-20-21, \"Sign Contractor License Fees and Sign Permit Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981. There is no fee for signs placed by a homeowner on residential property, for banners, or for exempt signs.\n(2)\tThe owner of a multi-tenant or multiple use property or an agent of the owner shall apply for all sign permits for the property or shall develop a plan for apportioning permitted sign area among tenants and file such plan with the city manager, in which case each tenant may apply for a sign permit in conformity with the plan.\n(3)\tThe applicant shall submit the following information as part of the application:\n(A)\tThe name, address, and telephone number of the owner or persons entitled to possession of the sign and of the sign contractor or installer;\n(B)\tThe street address or location of the proposed sign;\n(C)\tComplete information required on application forms provided by the city manager, including a site plan and elevation drawings of the proposed sign, copy of the proposed sign, and other data pertinent to the application;\n(D)\tPlans indicating the scope and structural detail of the work to be done, including details of all connections, guy lines, supports, footings, and materials to be used;\n(E)\tComplete application for an electrical permit for all electric signs if the person building the sign is to make the electrical connection; and\n(F)\tStatement of the sign's valuation.\n(4)\tWithin five working days of the date of the application, the city manager will either approve or deny the application or refer it back to the applicant for further information.\n(5)\tNo person issued a sign permit under this section shall change, modify, alter, or otherwise deviate from the terms or conditions of the approved application or permit without first requesting and obtaining approval to do so from the city manager.\n(6)\tIf the sign conforms to all other applicable requirements of this section, no permit is required for maintenance of the sign.\n(h)\tExpiration of Permit:\n(1)\tIf a person to whom a permit is granted under this section has not commenced work on the sign within sixty days from the date on which the permit was issued or if substantial building operations under such permit are suspended for a period of 60 consecutive days, the permit automatically expires, but the city manager may grant an extension of the time limits provided in this paragraph for construction delays that are not the result of willful acts or neglect by the permittee, upon a written request for such an extension received by the manager before expiration of the permit.\n(2)\tThe city manager shall not refund any permit fees paid under this section if any permit is revoked pursuant to subsection (t) of this section, or expires under this subsection.\n(i)\tInspections:\n(1)\tIn enforcing the provisions of this section, the city manager may enter any building, structure, or premises in the city at reasonable times to perform any duty imposed by this section.\n(2)\tThe city manager may require footing inspections on the day of excavation for a freestanding sign.\n(3)\tThe city manager may require inspection of an electrical sign before its erection within forty-eight hours after being notified that the sign is ready for inspection.\n(4)\tA permit holder or agent thereof shall notify the city manager when a sign is complete and ready for final inspection, which shall be no more than sixty days after work is commenced.\n(j)\tLicensed Sign Contractor Required to Install Signs: No person other than a sign contractor licensed under chapter 4-21, \"Sign Contractor License,\" B.R.C. 1981, shall install any sign for which a permit is required under this section, except:\n(1)\tA homeowner may install a sign on the premises of such person's residence, for which a permit is otherwise required, if the homeowner obtains a permit and complies with all requirements of this section other than that of licensed sign contractor installation.\n(2)\tBanner signs for which permits are required.\n(3)\tWindow signs for which permits are required.\n(k)\tSigns in Approved Site Review Developments:\n(1)\tA sign located in an approved site review development shall conform to all requirements of this section, including those of the district in which the property is located, except for those subsections dealing with sign setbacks from property lines and spacing between projecting and freestanding signs if alternative setbacks and spacing are specifically shown on a site plan approved under section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981, or approved as part of a sign program for the site review project. In no case may the total square footage for signage permitted under this section be increased through a site review or sign program.\n(2)\tSign lettering and graphic symbol height as specified in subparagraph (d)(14)(H) of this section concerning wall signs may also be varied in accordance with paragraph (k)(1) of this section.\n(3)\tIf a condition of site review development approval requires a uniform sign program, the following additional conditions shall apply:\n(A)\tThe owner or developer of the site review development shall submit a uniform sign program to the city manager for approval prior to the issuance of any sign permits within the planned unit development. Such program shall include, as a minimum:\n(i)\tType of sign permitted (wall sign, projecting sign, awning sign, window sign, etc.).\n(ii)\tType of construction (individual letters, cabinet, internal or indirect illumination, etc.).\n(iii)\tColor.\n(iv)\tSize of sign (maximum height of letters, maximum length of sign, and maximum size).\n(v)\tLocation of sign.\n(B)\tThe aggregate area of all signs and the size of any freestanding sign shall not exceed that permitted in subsection (e) of this section.\n(C)\tThe owner or developer of the site review development shall notify all potential tenants or property owners of the sign program at the time of sale or lease of the property.\n(D)\tThe property owner or developer or an authorized representative shall review all signs for compliance with the sign program prior to a tenant applying for a sign permit and shall countersign the application signifying such compliance.\n(E)\tThe sign program may not be altered without written permission of the city manager. In addition, no changes may be made without the written permission of a majority of tenants whose existing signs are in compliance with the previously established sign program.\n(4)\tThe city manager shall apply the following standards in approving or denying a sign program or request to alter a sign program:\n(A)\tAll signs shall be in compliance with law;\n(B)\tThe program shall ensure a reasonable degree of sign uniformity and coordination within the program area and will enhance the visual quality of the area;\n(C)\tThe program shall be simple, clear, and to the point;\n(D)\tThe program shall limit the number of signs allowed for each tenant of the area;\n(E)\tSigns shall be compatible with the area in color, shape, and materials;\n(F)\tA color plan for signs is required;\n(G)\tSigns are simple and clearly legible;\n(H)\tFreestanding signs are integrated in appearance with their surroundings; and\n(I)\tThe city manager shall not consider the content of the sign.\n(5)\tThe city manager may write uniform sign program guidelines to serve as an example of a sign program which meets the requirements of this subsection.\n(l)\tStructural Design Requirements:\n(1)\tSigns and sign structures shall be designed and constructed as specified in this subsection to resist wind and seismic forces. All bracing systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer lateral forces to the foundations. For signs on buildings, the dead and lateral loads shall be transmitted through the structural frame of the building to the ground so as not to overstress any of the elements thereof. The overturning moment produced from lateral forces may not exceed two-thirds of the dead load resisting moment. The structural frame of the building or the anchoring of the sign shall be adequate to resist uplift due to overturning. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead load resisting moment, if it is carefully placed and thoroughly compacted.\n(2)\tSigns and sign structures shall be designed and constructed in compliance with the city building code, chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981, including all requirements to resist seismic forces.\n(3)\tWind loads and seismic loads need not be combined in the design of signs or sign structures. Signs shall be designed to withstand the loading that produces the larger stresses. Vertical design loads, other than roof live loads, shall be assumed to be acting simultaneously with the wind or seismic loads.\n(4)\tThe design of structural members shall conform to the requirements of the city building code, chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981. Vertical and horizontal loads exerted on the soil shall not produce stresses exceeding those specified in the city building code.\n(5)\tThe working stresses of wire rope and its fastenings shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the ultimate strength of the rope or fastening. Working stresses for wind loads combined with dead loads may be increased as specified in the city building code, chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(m)\tConstruction Standards:\n(1)\tSigns and sign structures shall be securely built, constructed, and erected in conformity with the requirements of this subsection.\n(2)\tSupports for signs or sign structures shall not be placed on property not owned or leased by the sign owner.\n(3)\tMaterials of construction for signs and sign structures shall be of the quality and grade specified for buildings in the city building code, chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981. Plastic materials shall be those specified in the building code that have a flame spread rating of 0-25 or less and a smoke density no greater than that obtained from the burning of untreated wood under similar conditions when tested in accordance with the building code standards in the way intended for use. The products of combustion shall be no more toxic than the burning of untreated wood under similar conditions.\n(4)\tAll sign structures, except for construction signs, those signs specifically excepted in subparagraphs (c)(1)(A), (c)(1)(E), (c)(1)(G), (c)(1)(H), (c)(1)(J), and (c)(1)(L) of this section, window signs, and signs located inside buildings, shall have structural members of heavy timber or incombustible material. Wall signs, projecting signs, and awning signs shall be constructed of incombustible material, except as provided in paragraph (m)(5) of this section or as specifically approved by the city manager. No combustible materials other than approved plastic shall be used in the construction of electric signs.\n(5)\tNonstructural elements of a sign may be of wood, metal, approved plastic, or any combination thereof.\n(6)\tMembers supporting unbraced signs shall be so proportioned that the bearing loads imposed on the soil either vertically or horizontally do not exceed safe values. Braced ground signs shall be anchored to resist specified wind or seismic loads acting in any direction. Anchors and supports shall be designed for safe bearing loads on the soil for effective resistance to pull-out amounting to a force of twenty-five percent greater than the required resistance to a depth of not less than three feet. Anchors and supports shall be guarded and protected when near driveways, parking lots, or similar locations where they could be damaged by moving vehicles.\n(7)\tSigns attached to masonry, concrete, or steel shall be safely and securely fastened thereto by means of metal anchors, bolts, or approved expansion screws of sufficient size and anchorage to support safely the loads applied.\n(8)\tNo anchor or support of any sign, except flat wall signs, shall be connected to or supported by an unbraced parapet wall.\n(9)\tDisplay surfaces in all types of signs shall be of metal or other approved materials.\n(10)\tSigns intended for temporary placement of less than six months and which have no electrical or other special features:\n(A)\tIf less than six square feet per face and under four feet in height, may be constructed of any sturdy material and shall be anchored securely to the ground or a building, fence, or other structure and may be supported by any suitable support which will withstand the wind loading.\n(B)\tA freestanding sign more than six square feet in area or four feet or more in height shall have at least two supports pounded at least two feet into the ground.\n(C)\tConstruction site signs placed over concrete or asphalt or other materials into which posts may not conveniently be driven may instead be held in place by weights sufficient to withstand the wind.\n(11)\tThe city manager may approve the use of any material if an applicant submits sufficient technical data to substantiate such proposed use and if the manager determines that such material is satisfactory for the use intended.\n(12)\tWhere any freestanding sign has a clearance of less than eight feet from the ground, there shall be provided a barrier or other adequate protection to prevent hazard to pedestrians and motorists.\n(n)\tElectric Signs:\n(1)\tAn electric sign shall be constructed of incombustible material. An electric sign shall be rain tight, but service holes fitted with waterproof covers may be provided to each compartment of such sign. All electric signs installed or erected in the city shall bear the label of Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., on the exterior of the sign.\n(2)\tNo electric sign shall be erected or maintained that does not comply with the city electrical code, Chapter 10-6, \"Electrical Code,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tNo electric equipment or electrical apparatus of any kind that causes interference with radio or television reception shall be used in the operation of an illuminated sign. Whenever interference is caused by a sign that is unfiltered, improperly filtered, or otherwise defective, or by any other electrical device or apparatus connected to the sign, the city manager may order the sign disconnected until it is repaired.\n(o)\tSign Maintenance: No person shall fail to maintain a sign on such person's premises, including signs exempt from the permit requirements by subsection (c) of this section, in good structural condition at all times. All signs, including all metal parts and supports thereof that are not galvanized or of rust-resistant metals, shall be kept neatly painted. The city manager is authorized to inspect and may order the painting, repair, alteration, or removal of a sign that constitutes a hazard to safety, health, or public welfare because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or obsolescence, under the procedures prescribed by subsection (t) of this section.\n(p)\tContinuation of Legal Nonconforming Signs: A legal nonconforming sign that is not required to be discontinued under the provisions of subsection (q) of this section, may be continued and shall be maintained in good condition as required by subsection (o) of this section, but it shall not be:\n(1)\tStructurally changed to another nonconforming sign, to a degree that would require a sign permit;\n(2)\tStructurally altered in order to prolong the life of the sign, except to meet safety requirements;\n(3)\tAltered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign;\n(4)\tExpanded;\n(5)\tRe-established after its discontinuance for ninety days;\n(6)\tContinued in use after cessation or change of the business or activity to which the sign pertains;\n(7)\tRe-established after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction exceeds fifty percent of the appraised replacement cost as determined by the city manager; or\n(8)\tIf the landmarks board finds that a sign which otherwise would violate this section was, before January 6, 1972, an integral part of a building, since designated as a landmark, or in a historic district since designated, pursuant to Chapter 9-11, \"Historic Preservation,\" B.R.C. 1981, and is a substantial aspect of the pre-1972 historic character of such building, then such a sign is exempt from the provisions of paragraphs (p)(2), (p)(6), and (p)(7) of this section, and the period of discontinuance for such a sign in paragraph (p)(5) of this section shall be one year.\n(q)\tDiscontinuance of Prohibited Legal Nonconforming Signs:\n(1)\tExcept as provided in paragraph (q)(2) or (q)(3) of this section, a legal nonconforming sign prohibited by subsection (b) of this section shall be removed or brought into conformity with the provisions of this section within sixty days from the date on which the sign became nonconforming.\n(2)\tA legal nonconforming sign described in subparagraph (b)(3)(C), (b)(3)(D), (b)(3)(H), or (b)(3)(K) of this section is subject to the amortization provisions of subsection (r) of this section, unless excepted by paragraph (q)(3) of this section.\n(3)\tExisting legal signs in the city which became nonconforming solely because of a change in this sign code enacted by Ordinance No. 5186 (1989) or Ordinance No. 6017 (1998) are subject to all the requirements of subsection (p) of this section, but are not subject to the sixty-day discontinuance provisions of paragraph (q)(1) of this section or the amortization provisions of subsection (r) of this section. Such amortization provisions are also inapplicable to lawfully permitted nonconforming advertising devices, as those terms are defined and applied in the Outdoor Advertising Act, 43-1-401 et seq., C.R.S. The city manager is authorized, subject to appropriation, to remove such devices by eminent domain proceedings.\n(r)\tAmortization Provisions: Except for signs described in paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(3) of this section, or a temporary sign, a legal nonconforming sign shall be brought into conformity or removed under the following schedule:\n(1)\tA sign that exceeds the maximum area or height limitations of this section by twenty percent or less will be treated as a conforming sign and need not be removed or altered, but if such sign is replaced or renovated it shall conform to all requirements of this section.\n(2)\tA sign having an original cost of $100.00 or less shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of this section or removed within sixty days after the date on which the sign became nonconforming under this section.\n(3)\tA sign having an original cost exceeding $100.00 that is nonconforming only in the respect that it does not meet the requirements of this section concerning height, setback, distance between signs on the same or adjacent properties, or limitations on window signs, shall be brought into conformity with the requirements of this section or removed or a contract for timely completion of such work shall be executed within one hundred eighty days after the date upon which the sign became nonconforming under this section.\n(4)\tA sign having an original cost exceeding $100.00 that is nonconforming as to permitted sign area or any other provision of this section that would require the complete removal or total replacement of the sign may be maintained for the longer of the following periods:\n(A)\tThree years from the date upon which the sign became nonconforming under the provisions of this section by annexation or code amendment; or\n(B)\tA period of three to seven years from the installation date or most recent renovation date that preceded the date on which the sign became nonconforming. But if the date of renovation is chosen as the starting date of the amortization period, such period of amortization shall be calculated according to the cost of the renovation and not according to the original cost of the sign. The amortization periods in Table 9-10 of this section apply according to the original cost of the sign, including installation costs, or of the renovation:\nTABLE 9-10: AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE\n(5)\tTo be eligible for an amortization period longer than three years pursuant to subparagraph (r)(4)(B) of this section, the owner of a sign shall, within one year from the date on which the sign became nonconforming, file with the city manager a statement setting forth the cost of such nonconforming sign, the date of erection or the cost and date of most recent renovation, and a written agreement to remove or bring the nonconforming sign into conformity with all provisions of this section at or before the expiration of the amortization period applicable to the sign.\n(s)\tAppeals and Variances:\n(1)\tAny aggrieved person who contests an interpretation of this section which causes denial of a permit, or who believes a violation alleged in a notice of violation issued pursuant to paragraph (t)(2) or (t)(3) of this section, to be factually or legally incorrect, may appeal the denial or notice of violation to the BOZA or board of building appeals in a manner provided by either such board under the procedures prescribed by Chapter 1-3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981, or may, in the case of a denial, request that a variance be granted. An appeal from a denial and a request for a variance may be filed in the alternative.\n(A)\tAn appeal from an interpretation which causes denial of a permit or from a notice alleging a violation of subsections (l), (m), (n), and (o) of this section shall be filed with the BOZA.\n(B)\tAn appeal from any other interpretation alleging any other violation of this section shall be filed with the BOZA.\n(C)\tAn appellant shall file the appeal, request for variance, or both in the alternative with the BOZA within fifteen days from the date of notice of the denial or the date of service of the notice of violation. The appellant may request more time to file. If the appellant makes such request before the end of the time period and shows good cause therefore, the city manager may extend for a reasonable period the time to file with either board.\n(2)\tNo person may appeal to or request a variance from the BOZA if the person has displayed, constructed, erected, altered, or relocated a sign without a sign permit required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The boards have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal nor authority to grant any variance from the permit requirements of this section. But the BOZA has jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a notice of violation alleging violation of the permit requirements if the appeal is from the manager's interpretation that a permit is required, and the appellant's position is that the device is not a sign or that it is exempt from the permit requirements under subsection (c) of this section.\n(3)\tAn applicant for an appeal or a variance under this subsection shall pay the fee prescribed by Subsection 4-20-47(b), B.R.C. 1981.\n(4)\tSetbacks, spacing of freestanding and projecting signs, and sign noise limitations are the only requirements which the BOZA may vary. If an applicant requests that the BOZA grant such a variance, the board shall not grant a variance unless it finds that each of the following conditions exists:\n(A)\tThere are special physical circumstances or physical conditions, including, without limitation, buildings, topography, vegetation, sign structures, or other physical features on adjacent properties or within the adjacent public right-of-way that would substantially restrict the effectiveness of the sign in question, and such special circumstances or conditions are peculiar to the particular business or enterprise to which the applicant desires to draw attention and do not apply generally to all businesses or enterprises in the area; or\n(B)\tFor variances from the noise limitations of subparagraph (b)(3)(L) of this section, the proposed variance is temporary in duration (not to exceed thirty days) and consists of a temporary exhibition of auditory art; and\n(C)\tThe variance would be consistent with the purposes of this section and would not adversely affect the neighborhood in which the business or enterprise or exhibition to which the applicant desires to draw attention is located; and\n(D)\tThe variance is the minimum one necessary to permit the applicant reasonably to draw attention to its business, enterprise, or exhibition.\n(5)\tIf an applicant requests that the board of building appeals approve alternate materials or methods of construction or modifications from the requirements of subsections (l), (m), (n), and (o) of this section, the board may approve the same under the standards and procedures provided in the city building code, Chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(6)\tExcept as provided in paragraph (s)(7) of this section, the BOZA has no jurisdiction to hear a request for nor authority to grant a variance that would increase the maximum permitted sign area on a single property or building, or from the prohibitions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. But the BOZA has jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a permit denial or of a notice of violation alleging that a sign would exceed the maximum permitted sign area or is prohibited if the appellant's position is that the sign does not exceed such area or is not prohibited by such paragraph.\n(7)\tThe BOZA or board of building appeals may make any variance or alternate material or method approval or modification it grants subject to any reasonable conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to make the device that is permitted by the variance compatible with the purposes of this section.\n(8)\tThe city manager's denial or notice of violation becomes a final order of the BOZA or board of building appeals if:\n(A)\tThe applicant fails to appeal the manager's denial or order to the board within the prescribed time limit;\n(B)\tThe applicant fails to appeal the order of the board to a court of competent jurisdiction within the prescribed time limit; or\n(C)\tA court of competent jurisdiction enters a final order and judgment upon an appeal filed from a decision of the board under this section.\n(t)\tEnforcement:\n(1)\tThe city manager may enforce the provisions of this section in any one or more of the following ways:\n(A)\tBy issuing a criminal summons and complaint, followed by prosecution in municipal court.\n(B)\tIf the city manager desires to use self-help to remove a sign for which a permit has been issued, by issuing a notice of violation, revoking a permit, removing a sign, and collecting the cost of removal pursuant to paragraph (t)(2) of this section.\n(C)\tIf the city manager desires to use self-help to remove or correct a sign for which no permit has been issued, by issuing a notice of violation, correcting the violation, and collecting the cost of correction pursuant to paragraph (t)(3) of this section.\n(D)\tBy removing any sign posted in violation of Subsection 5-4-15(a), B.R.C. 1981, concerning posting signs on government property. Such signs are a public nuisance. After such removal the manager may also file a civil complaint in municipal court against the person who posted the sign or the beneficiary of the sign or both. The court shall award the city as damages the costs of removal of the sign and restoration of the surface upon which it was posted. This judgment shall be enforceable as any civil judgment.\n(E)\tBy filing a civil complaint for declaratory or injunctive relief in District Court.\nThese remedies are cumulative and not exclusive, and use of one does not foreclose use of any other also.\n(2)\tIf the city manager finds that any sign for which a permit has been issued does not comply with the permit or approved permit application or violates any provision of this section or any other ordinance of the city, the manager may send a notice of violation to the owner of the sign by first class mail to the address on the sign permit application. The notice shall state the violation, and any required corrections, and that if the corrections are not made within thirty days or an appeal filed within fifteen days pursuant to subsection (s) of this section, the permit shall be revoked, and the manager may then proceed as specified in paragraphs (t)(4) and (t)(5) of this section.\n(3)\tThe city manager may issue a notice of violation ordering the sign owner or possessor or property owner to alter or remove a sign which is in violation of this section and for which no permit has been issued within thirty days from the date of the notice. Notice under this paragraph is sufficient if it is mailed first class to the address of the last known owner of the real property on which the sign is located as shown on the records of the Boulder County Assessor. The notice shall state the violation, order removal of the sign or state any reasonable corrections which would bring the sign into compliance with this section, and that if removal or correction is not accomplished within thirty days or an appeal filed within fifteen days pursuant to subsection (s) of this section, the manager may proceed as specified in paragraphs (t)(4) and (t)(5) of this section. If the violation is of paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, the manager may require removal of the illegal sign within one day from the date of actual notice or five days from the date of mailing of mailed notice.\n(4)\tIf the property owner or sign owner or possessor fails to complete alteration or removal as required by the notice given as prescribed by paragraph (t)(2) or (t)(3) of this section, or to appeal pursuant to subsection (s) of this section, or loses such appeal and it becomes a final order pursuant to paragraph (s)(8) of this section, the city manager may cause such sign to be altered or removed at the expense of the owner or possessor of the property or sign and charge the costs thereof to such person.\n(5)\tIf any property owner fails or refuses to pay when due any charge imposed under this subsection, the city manager may, in addition to taking other collection remedies, certify due and unpaid charges, including interest, to the Boulder County Treasurer to be levied against the person's property for collection by the county in the same manner as delinquent general taxes upon such property are collected, as provided in Section 2-2-12, \"City Manager May Certify Taxes, Charges, and Assessments to County Treasurer for Collection,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(6)\tThe penalty for violation of any provision of this section is a fine of not more than $2,000.00 per violation. In addition, upon conviction of any person for violation of this section, the court may issue a cease and desist order and any other orders reasonably calculated to remedy the violation. Violation of any order of the court issued under this subsection is a violation of this subsection, and is punishable by a fine of not more than $4,000.00 per violation, or incarceration for not more than ninety days in jail, or both such fine and incarceration.\n(u)\tRules and Regulations: The city manager is authorized to adopt reasonable procedural rules and interpretive regulations consistent with the provisions of this section to aid in its implementation and enforcement.\n(v)\tCompliance With State Law Required: In addition to compliance with this section, all signs to which the provisions of the Outdoor Advertising Act, 43-1-401 et seq., C.R.S., and its supplemental regulations apply shall comply with such Act and regulations. Signs which do not so comply shall be deemed illegal nonconforming signs under this section.\n(w)\tSubstitution Clause: It is the intention of the city council that this sign code not favor commercial over noncommercial messages. However, all sign codes are complex, and sometimes when provisions which do not appear to be related are read together, unintended results may occur. If any provision of this code is judicially construed to allow a commercial message but not a noncommercial message, then the property owner may substitute any noncommercial message under the same limitations as to physical characteristics and location of the sign as would apply to a commercial message on such sign.\nOrdinance Nos. 4879 (1984); 5186 (1989); 5223 (1989); 5255 (1989); 5377 (1991); 5562 (1993); 5639 (1994); 5640 (1994); 5930 (1997); 7332 (2004); 7365 (2004); 7484 (2006); 7522 (2007); 7777 (2011); 8005 (2014); 8038 (2015); 8111 (2016); 8696 (2025)"

    "verbatim": "9-9-22. Trip Generation Requirements for the MU-4, RH-6 and RH-7 Zoning Districts.\n(a)\tPurpose. The purpose of this section is to provide the trip generation requirements for the MU-4, RH-6 and RH-7 zoning districts for developments that are not served by a general improvement district or other approved organization that provides transportation related services. Further, it is the purpose of this section to:\n(1)\tProvide approaches to mitigate the impacts of traffic generated by development and redevelopment.\n(2)\tEnsure that the amount of land used for parking is the minimum necessary to serve development in the area.\n(3)\tProvide opportunities for parking that is provided in a development to be used in an efficient manner during all times of the day or evening.\n(b)\tScope. The applicant for any additional floor area for a property located in the MU-4, RH-6 and RH-7 zoning districts shall demonstrate that the development does not exceed the trip generation allowance standards of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to development proposals within general improvement districts or other organizations that have service plans which include transportation demand management and parking management programs that have been approved by the city council to generally meet the objectives described in this section.\n(c)\tTrip Generation Allowance. The applicant for any development subject to the requirements of this section shall demonstrate that a certain percentage of trips generated by the development during the highest peak travel time will be by alternative modes or avoided, as specified below:\n(1)\tIn all areas except the Alpine-Balsam and East Boulder areas identified in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" B.R.C. 1981, at least fifty-five percent of the trips generated by the development shall be by alternative modes or avoided.\n(2)\tIn the Alpine-Balsam form-based code area, at least 30 percent of the trips generated by the development shall be by alternative modes or avoided.\n(3)\tIn the East Boulder form-based code areas, at least 30 percent of the trips generated by the development shall be by alternative modes or avoided.\n(4)\tAlternative modes are modes of transportation other than single occupant motor-vehicle use and include, without limitation, walking, bicycling, carpooling, vanpooling, micromobility, or public transportation.\n(5)\tTrips are avoided through programs such as alternate work schedules, including telecommuting or compressed work week programs.\n(d)\tTrip Generation Calculation. The trip generation allowance shall be calculated using standard calculation methods commonly accepted by the Institute of Traffic Engineers for the uses of land that are proposed for the development during the highest peak travel times. The applicant shall provide the city manager with information necessary to demonstrate that the appropriate number of trips for the proposed development has been provided.\n(e)\tTrip Reduction and Mitigation. The applicant shall demonstrate how it will achieve the alternative mode use and trip avoidance required pursuant to subsection (c) at the highest peak travel time through a transportation demand management plan.\n(f)\tTransportation Demand Management Plan. A transportation demand management plan shall be submitted with all development applications that add a nonresidential use floor area or an additional dwelling unit that demonstrates compliance with the trip generation requirements. Any combination of the following methods may be incorporated into the transportation demand management plan to achieve the requirements of this section.\n(1)\tParking management strategies.\n(2)\tEnhanced design and amenities.\n(3)\tFinancial incentives.\n(4)\tTrip reduction and avoidance programs and policies.\n(5)\tMarketing and outreach.\n(g)\tComponents of a Transportation Demand Management Plan. An applicant may divide a transportation demand management plan into two components: (1) infrastructure and amenities; and (2) a transportation demand management operations program. As part of a development approval, the city manager will approve separate trip generation reductions attributable to each element of the transportation demand management plan.\n(1)\tInfrastructure and Amenities. The infrastructure and amenities component of the transportation demand management plan shall include all of the elements of the transportation demand management plan that require the construction of either private or public improvements. The improvements may include, without limitation, facilities such as showers and changing facilities, parking area design, amenities that support alternate mode use such as covered and secure bicycle parking or enhanced pedestrian, bicycle and transit access. Unless otherwise approved in the infrastructure and amenities plan, all public and private improvements shall be constructed prior to or concurrent with the construction of the buildings within the development. If construction of such improvements is to occur later, the applicant shall submit, subject to the review and approval of the city manager, an improvement construction phasing plan. The applicant shall demonstrate that phasing of the construction of improvements is necessary because such improvement cannot be effectively or efficiently utilized until a given level of development has been completed on the property.\n(2)\tDemand Management Operations Program. The demand management operations program shall be the plan that is used by the tenant or occupant of a development or a portion thereof. The demand management operations plan shall include those programs necessary to meet the trip reduction requirements of this section, including without limitation the following:\n(A)\tParking management strategies that may include unbundled parking, paid parking areas or carpool or vanpool preferred parking areas.\n(B)\tActive promotion of alternate modes through marketing and outreach programs to employees or residents.\n(C)\tFinancial incentives for employees or residents to alternate modes such as public transit passes, subsidized transit or vanpool fares or a parking cash-out program.\n(D)\tPolicies and programs including bicycle or carshare services, telework stations in residential buildings or telecommuting and compressed work week programs for employees.\n(E)\tA plan for monitoring the effectiveness of the transportation demand management plan that is submitted to the city manager on a biannual basis, using guidelines and performance measures developed by the city. The monitoring plan shall state whether the monitoring shall be done by the owner, occupant, tenant or other designated organization.\n(3)\tSustainable Funding. The costs of a transportation demand management program shall be the responsibility of the owner, occupants, tenants or visitors to the development. The applicant shall be required to demonstrate how the facilities and programs will be initially funded and funded over time to ensure implementation and ongoing operation of the facilities and programs.\n(h)\tMonitoring and Evaluation. The owner of any property that has a transportation demand management plan shall be responsible for ensuring that the monitoring and evaluation component of the transportation demand management plan is completed as required by this section. Monitoring and evaluation data shall be submitted to the city manager on a biannual basis. The monitoring and evaluation data shall be in a form acceptable to the city manager and shall address the effectiveness of the approved transportation demand management plan in reaching the trip generation requirements of this section. If the monitoring data shows that the transportation demand management plan is not meeting the trip generation requirements of this section, the owner shall submit a revised transportation demand management plan that meets the requirements of this section within thirty days of a request by the city manager.\n(i)\tCity Manager May Issue Rules. The city manager may adopt rules necessary for the implementation and interpretation of this chapter under the procedures of Chapter 1-4, \"Rulemaking,\" B.R.C. 1981. Such rules may address, without limitation, the following topics:\n(1)\tMethods for determining how programs and facilities impact trip generation rates;\n(2)\tMethods of evaluating approved travel demand management plans during the biannual review processes; and\n(3)\tMonitoring procedures and practices for approved travel demand management plans.\n(j)\tCompliance Required. No person shall fail to comply with the requirements of this section or any rule issued by the city manager under this section. No person shall fail to submit the operations monitoring component of a demand management operations plan to the city manager on at least an annual basis. No person shall violate the terms of an approved travel demand management plan.\nOrdinance Nos. 7655 (2009); 8668 (2024); 8669 (2025)"

For the purposes of this review, on-site relocation shall mean the relocation of the building on the current building site. Off-site relocation shall mean the relocation of the building off the current building site.\n(d)\tInitial Review: The initial review shall occur within twenty-one days after the city manager accepts a completed permit application to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the building may be eligible for designation as an individual landmark consistent with the purposes and standards in sections 9-11-1, \"Legislative Intent,\" and 9-11-2, \"City Council May Designate or Amend Landmarks and Historic Districts,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(1)\tStaff Review: The city manager may review permit applications for all accessory buildings over fifty years old, all on-site relocations of buildings over fifty years old, and all demolition and off-site relocations for primary buildings constructed during or after 1940.

If the city manager determines that there is probable cause to believe that the building may be eligible for designation as an individual landmark, the issuance of the permit shall be stayed for up to sixty days from the date that a completed application is accepted by the city manager, and the permit shall be referred to the landmarks board for a public hearing. The applicant shall be notified of the initial review determination within fourteen days of the decision.\n(2)\tCommittee Review: The city manager and two designated members of the landmarks board shall review all demolition and off-site relocation permit applications for buildings built prior to 1940.

At least ten days before the hearing, the city manager shall also:\n(1)\tPost the property subject to the application to indicate that a permit review appeal has been requested; and\n(2)\tMail written notice to the record owners of the property subject to the application. If the address of the property owner is not a matter of public record, any failure to send notice by mail does not invalidate any proceedings on the permit application.\n(f)\tLandmarks Board Public Hearings on Permits: The landmarks board shall hold a public hearing on the permit application within seventy-five days after the city manager accepts a completed application, pursuant to the procedures prescribed by chapter 1-3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981. If the landmarks board fails to hold a public hearing within seventy-five days after the city manager accepts a completed permit application, the city manager shall issue the permit if all other requirements of the permit process have been met.

Topography and other natural features and constraints may justify deviations from this criterion.\n(ii)\tLot Layout and Building Siting: Lots are oriented and buildings sited in a way which maximizes the solar potential of each principal building. Lots are designed so that it would be easy to site a structure which is unshaded by other nearby structures and so as to allow for owner control of shading. Lots also are designed so that buildings can be sited so as to maximize the solar potential of adjacent properties by minimizing off-site shading.\n(iii)\tBuilding Form: The shapes of buildings are designed to maximize utilization of solar energy. Existing and proposed buildings shall meet the solar access protection and solar siting requirements of Section 9-9-17, \"Solar Access,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(iv)\tLandscaping: The shading impact of proposed landscaping on adjacent buildings is addressed by the applicant.

Based upon the review and consideration of recent housing studies, reports and analysis, it has become clear that the provisions of this chapter are necessary to preserve a diversity of housing opportunities for the city's residents and working people.\n(b)\tThe program defined by this chapter is necessary to provide continuing housing opportunities for very low-, low-, moderate-, and middle-income households. It is necessary to help maintain a diverse housing stock and to allow people to have better access to jobs and upgrade their economic status. It is necessary to provide housing to persons of all needs and abilities to have a place in the community. The strong employment base in this region, combined with the special attractiveness of Boulder, its University-related population and its environmentally sensitive urban service boundaries, all combine to make the continued provision of decent housing options for very low-, low-, moderate and middle-income and working people in Boulder a difficult but vital objective. The regional trend toward increasing housing prices will, without intervention, result in inadequate supplies of affordable housing here for very low-, low-, moderate and middle-income households. This in turn will have a negative effect upon the ability of local employers to maintain an adequate local work force.\n(c)\tIt is essential that appropriate housing options exist for university students, faculty and staff so that the housing needs of university-related populations do not preclude non-university community members from finding affordable housing.\n(d)\tA housing shortage for persons of very low-, low-, moderate and middle-income is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare. The inability of such persons to reside within the city negatively affects the community's jobs/housing balance and has serious and detrimental transportation and environmental consequences.\n(e)\tBecause remaining land appropriate for residential development within the city is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be developed into housing units affordable to very low-, low-, moderate and middle-income residents and working people. This is particularly true because of the tendency, in the absence of interventions, for large expensive housing to be developed within the city, which both reduces opportunities for more affordable housing and contributes to a general rise in prices for all housing in the community, thus exacerbating the scarcity of affordable housing within the city.\n(f)\tThe primary objective of this chapter is to obtain a significant amount of permanently affordable dwelling units. Provisions of this chapter provide for various approaches to creating additional affordable housing units. Those provisions recognize the fact that individual site, legal and economic factors have an impact on which alternatives will work for different developments.\n(g)\tThe intent of this chapter is that any resulting affordable housing units and developments will be distributed either within each development when provided on-site or at a building/neighborhood level when provided off-site and will be found throughout the community and not concentrated in certain areas of the city.\n(h)\tAs land for new residential development becomes scarcer, redevelopment of existing housing will increase. The newly built housing that results will likely be more expensive than the housing it replaces. This is especially true of larger redevelopments. Smaller scale developments are less able to absorb development costs than are larger developments that can benefit from economies of scale. This chapter recognizes the differences between developments of different sizes and the inherent inefficiencies in smaller developments and seeks to not disproportionally affect smaller redevelopments within the City.\n(i)\tThis inclusionary housing requirement is based upon the city's power to enact zoning regulations that promote the health, safety and welfare of the community. For the reasons cited above, the promotion and maintenance of a diverse housing stock is an important component of the city's zoning regulations.\nOrdinance Nos. 8201 (2017); 8601 (2024)"

    "verbatim": "9-13-10. Options for Satisfaction of Inclusionary Housing Requirement.\n(a)\tPurpose: In order to create a significant amount of permanently affordable units, to the extent permitted by this chapter, developers may satisfy the inclusionary housing requirement through any combination of the following alternate means:\n(1)\tCash-in-Lieu Contribution: Developers may satisfy permanently affordable housing requirements by making cash contributions to the city's affordable housing fund. The cash-in-lieu contribution will be based on the residential square footage of the development creating the inclusionary housing requirement and the applicable rate will be determined annually by the city manager. The city manager may consider the number of units in the development, the size and type of units which created the obligation , the amount that would incentivize on-site construction of permanently affordable units, and the affordability gap between market rate and permanently affordable unit prices when determining the cash-in-lieu calculation.\n(A)\tAnnual Cash-in-lieu Escalator: The city manager is authorized to adjust the cash-in-lieu contribution annually on January 1 of each year.\n(B)\tAffordable Housing Fund Established: The city manager will establish an affordable housing fund for the receipt and management of permanently affordable unit cash-in-lieu contributions. Monies received into that fund will be utilized solely for the construction, purchase and maintenance of affordable housing and for the costs of administering programs consistent with the purposes of this chapter.\n(2)\tProvision of Affordable Units Off-site:\n(A)\tThe intent of this option is that the off-site unit mix of permanently affordable units will be proportionate in type and size to the mix of market rate units in the development that generated the requirement for the permanently affordable units (the \"Sending Site\"). Recognizing that an off-site location is unique and may have different zoning and other planning considerations than the Sending Site, the city manager may meet the intent of this chapter by modifying the requirements in Sections 9-13-6 and 9-13-7, B.R.C. 1981, to accommodate the off-site constraints.\n(B)\tTo the extent permitted by this chapter, inclusionary housing requirements may be satisfied by restricting existing or newly constructed rental or for-sale off-site dwelling units which are approved by the city manager as suitable permanently affordable units through covenants, contractual arrangements or resale restrictions, the form and content of which are acceptable to the city manager. Off-site permanently affordable units shall be located within the City of Boulder.\n(C)\tThe city manager is authorized to develop rules for approving, assessing, and monitoring the off-site development.\n(D)\tOff-site Agreement: Any development meeting the requirements of this chapter by providing permanently affordable units off-site shall be subject to the provisions of an off-site agreement as approved by the city manager. The off-site agreement must be executed prior to application for any residential building permit for the Sending Site.\n(E)\tFinancial Guarantee: The city manager may require a financial guarantee to secure the off-site units prior to issuing a building permit for the Sending Site.\n(F)\tTiming of Construction for Off-site Units: The intent of this section is to provide concurrency of construction and marketing between permanently affordable units and market rate units.\n(i)\tIf newly constructed dwelling units are used to satisfy the requirements of this chapter as permanently affordable units the applicant shall demonstrate that such units meet the following minimum requirements:\na.\tThe permanently affordable units shall pass final inspection no later than one year after the last market rate unit in the Sending Site passes final inspection; and\nb.\tThe permanently affordable units shall be offered for sale or rent no later than one year after the final inspection of the last market rate unit in the Sending Site.\n(ii)\tIf existing dwelling units are used to satisfy the requirements of this chapter as permanently affordable units, the applicant shall demonstrate that such units meet the following minimum requirements:\na.\tThe applicant provides a letter of completion for any rehabilitation or remodeling, subject to city manager review and approval, that establishes that the permanently affordable units are habitable no later than one year after the last market rate unit in the Sending Site receives a certificate of occupancy; and\nb.\tThe permanently affordable units are offered for sale or rent no later than one year after the last market rate unit in the Sending Site receives a certificate of occupancy.\n(G)\tTiming of Marketing: The marketing of the permanently affordable units should start two months before the permanently affordable units are expected to receive a certificate of occupancy.\n(H)\tOff-Site Location Subject to Inclusionary Requirement: All newly constructed permanently affordable units provided off-site are subject to the requirements of this chapter.\n(I)\tOff-Site Location Review and Approval: Any proposed off-site location is required to be approved by the city manager.\n(3)\tLand Dedication:\n(A)\tPurpose: The inclusionary housing requirement may be satisfied by the dedication of land to the City of Boulder or an entity designated by the City of Boulder for permanently affordable units in accordance with the provisions of this.\n(B)\tGeneral Requirements: A land dedication shall meet all of the following criteria to the satisfaction of the city:\n(i)\tThe location of the land would meet city affordable housing objectives and is required to be approved by the city manager;\n(ii)\tThe land can reasonably be developed for affordable housing;\n(iii)\tThe land is in an environmentally acceptable condition as supported by a Phase I Environmental Assessment as approved by the city manager. The city manager may require other studies or assessments to make this determination;\n(iv)\tNo greater than ten percent of the land may be within the high hazard zone or conveyance zone. No greater than twenty-five percent of the land may be within the one-hundred-year floodplain. If any portion of the land is in the high hazard zone, conveyance zone or one-hundred-year floodplain, the city manager will have the sole discretion to determine if the land is appropriate for affordable housing development.\n(v)\tSatisfactory proof of title is provided to the city manager within thirty days before the effective date of dedication to the city or an entity designated by the city for such dedication. The land will be free of all liens and encumbrances and all property taxes and special taxes will be current before the title for the dedicated land is conveyed. The land will be conveyed by special warranty deed before issuance of a building permit for the Sending Site.\n(vi)\tDedicated land plus any cash-in-lieu contributed must be of equivalent or greater value to the total cash-in-lieu contribution amount. The value of the land will be determined, at the cost of the developer, by an independent appraiser, who will be selected from a list of Colorado Certified General Appraiser provided by the city, or by such alternative means of valuation to which a developer and the city may agree.\n(vii)\tIf the land does not equal the full amount of the cash-in-lieu owed, the applicant shall contribute cash-in-lieu to make up any gap between the value of the donated land and the total cash-in-lieu contribution amount.\n(C)\tOpen Space Requirement: If land proposed to be dedicated under this subparagraph is part of the same site review as the market rate units that create the inclusionary housing requirement the open space requirements for any permanently affordable units constructed on the land proposed to be dedicated shall be met entirely on the land proposed to be dedicated and the open space requirements for the market rate units shall be met entirely within the market rate unit development.\n(4)\tAlternative methods of compliance. The city manager is authorized to enter into agreements to allow alternative methods of compliance for the inclusionary housing requirements contained within this chapter. The applicant shall provide all documentation and any other material requested by the city manager. An applicant for an alternative method of compliance will demonstrate that the proposed method of compliance:\n(A)\tWill result in additional affordable housing benefits for the city consistent with the purposes of this chapter; or\n(B)\tWill address unmet housing needs; or\n(C)\tIs necessary to prevent an unlawful taking of property without just compensation in accordance with Section 9-13-15, \"No Taking of Property Without Just Compensation,\" B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance Nos. 8201 (2017); 8601 (2024); 8620 (2024)"

The city manager will establish maximum asset limitation requirements for purchasers of permanently affordable units in order to accomplish the purposes of this chapter. The standard that the city manager will use to set the asset limitation is that the housing be available to people who, without assistance, would have difficulty marshaling the financial resources to obtain appropriate housing within the city.\n(g)\tSale Restriction: No person shall sell a permanently affordable unit except to a person that meets the income, asset and other eligibility requirements of this chapter or any asset and income eligibility requirement that is included in any contract, covenant or any other agreement to which the city is a party or beneficiary.\n(h)\tRental Restrictions for For-Sale Permanently Affordable Units:\n(1)\tRental Restrictions Pursuant to Sale: Newly constructed or existing units that are deed restricted are initially owned by a developer. Prior to the first sale of such units to a program eligible buyer and after receipt of a temporary or final certificate of occupancy, a developer who initially owns a permanently affordable unit is required to actively market the permanently affordable unit for a minimum of one hundred twenty days to facilitate a sale. Subsequent program-eligible owners must also market the permanently affordable unit for a minimum of one hundred twenty days to facilitate a sale. If, after this period, the permanently affordable unit has not sold, the unit may be rented for a one-time period not to exceed eighteen months. The developer or owner is required to continue to market the unit while it is being rented but may defer the sale to the end of the lease period. A written lease or rental agreement is required. The lease or agreement must be provided to the city division of housing.\n(2)\tAn owner may rent one bedroom in a permanently affordable unit for any period of time subject to city requirements concerning the renting of residential property.\n(3)\tThe provisions below apply to rental of the entirety of the for-sale permanently affordable units. The provisions of this section do not apply to any affordable housing developer who owns the permanently affordable unit initially prior to the first sale to a program-eligible owner.\n(A)\tNo owner shall fail to occupy a permanently affordable unit for a minimum of five years before renting the entirety of the unit.\n(B)\tNo owner shall fail to provide thirty days' notice to the city manager of intent to rent an affordable unit.\n(C)\tNo owner shall allow a permanently affordable unit to be rented for more than one year out of seven years.

All purchasers of permanently affordable units shall be part of program eligible households.\n(2)\tResale Price: The resale price of any permanently affordable unit shall not exceed the purchase price paid by the owner of that unit with the following exceptions:\n(A)\tClosing Costs: Customary closing costs and costs of sale as reviewed and approved by the city manager.\n(B)\tPermanent Capital Improvements: Consideration of eligible permanent capital improvements installed by the seller that have been approved in advance by the city manager in accordance with rules or administrative guidance established by the city manager.\n(C)\tResale Price: The resale price may include an inflationary factor or shared appreciation factor as applied to the original sale price pursuant to rules as may be established by the city manager to provide for such consideration. In developing rules, the city manager may consider the purposes of this chapter, common private, nonprofit and governmental lending practices, as well as any applicable rules or guidelines issued by federal or state agencies affecting the provision or management of affordable housing.

    "verbatim": "9-14-14. Requirements Applicable to All Building Types.\n(a)\tPurpose. The purpose of the building type requirements is to establish standards for building design, building form, siting of buildings, and specific uses based on the building type that may be utilized on a property pursuant to the applicable regulating plan or as otherwise authorized.\n(b)\tBuilding Types Requirements. No person shall develop, use, or occupy any building or other property located within the area designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" B.R.C. 1981, except in conformance with the building type standards of sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21 of this chapter unless modified through an exception under Subsection 9-2-16(i), B.R.C. 1981. This following generally describes the building types:\n(1)\tMain Street Storefront Description. The main street storefront building type is a highly pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use building. Ground story storefront is required along all Type A streets with only personal service, retail, dining, and entertainment uses to provide activity. Upper story uses are flexible. Parking is in the rear of the lot or located off-site. Refer to Section 9-14-16, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(2)\tCommercial Storefront Description. The commercial storefront building type permits single use buildings and more parking locations, but still addresses pedestrian orientation with buildings built up to the sidewalk and storefront glass requirements. This building type allows a broader variety of commercial, retail, and industrial uses on the ground story, including vehicle-related uses. Refer to Section 9-14-17, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(3)\tGeneral Building Description. The general building type is a basic building that serves as urban fabric, built along the sidewalk connecting the more commercial spaces with open spaces. This building can accommodate a wide range of uses. It differs from the storefront by its lower requirement for ground story glass and allowance for an above-sidewalk level ground story elevation. Refer to Section 9-14-18, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(4)\tRow Building Description. The row building type is similar to the general building but is smaller in scale. The ground story is required to be divided into different units, each with separate entrances. Townhouses, rowhouses, live-work units, incubator space, or small width industrial or craftsman spaces fit well into this building type. Refer to Section 9-14-19, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(5)\tWorkshop Building Description. The workshop building type is similar to the general building but allows the service base with garage door access more widely. The ground story is also typically taller to allow for production uses. Refer to Section 9-14-20, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(6)\tCivic Building Description. The civic building type is the most flexible building, meant to allow for more iconic designs within the urban fabric of the area. This building type is limited to specific public and institutional uses, such as governmental facilities, religious assemblies, schools, colleges, and universities, as well as parks and recreation uses, museums, and live theaters. Refer to Section 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(c)\tUses in Building Types. All uses of a property shall meet the requirements of Chapter 9-6, \"Use Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981. Where use regulations are imposed by this chapter based on the building type, the use of the property shall also be consistent with those standards.\n(d)\tGeneral Building Design Requirements. All buildings shall comply with the building design requirements of sections 9-14-22 through 9-14-33 of this chapter.\n(e)\tMultiple Principal Structures. Multiple structures may be constructed on a lot or parcel. All structures shall meet the applicable building type requirements, including the frontage setback requirements.\n(f)\tBuild to the Corner. On corners, a building or structure shall be located at the intersection of the two frontage setbacks as shown in Figure 14-24. The standards of Subparagraph 9-14-10(a)(3)(B), \"Sight Triangle Area,\" B.R.C. 1981, must also be met.\nFigure 14-24. Build-to Corner and Frontage Setbacks\n(g)\tStreetwall Courtyards. Where minimum streetwall is required and streetwall variation is not required, courtyards meeting the requirements of Paragraph 9-14-14(h)(1), B.R.C. 1981, are allowed provided they do not exceed thirty-five percent of the streetwall. The courtyard counts towards the required minimum streetwall percentage.\n(h)\tRequired Streetwall Variation. Where streetwall variation is required, a courtyard or streetscape plaza meeting the following requirements shall be provided for streetwall increment required per the building type:\n(1)\tCourtyard. Courtyards shall meet the following requirements:\n(A)\tThe courtyard is at least thirty feet in width and thirty feet in depth.\n(B)\tThe courtyard abuts the frontage setback.\n(C)\tThere is no motor vehicle parking in the courtyard.\n(D)\tThe courtyard facades are treated with the frontage type of the adjacent street frontage per facade requirements for the building type and building design requirements in Sections 9-14-27 through 9-14-33, B.R.C. 1981.\n(E)\tThe courtyard design includes the following:\n(i)\tNo more than sixty-five percent of the area is paved and the hardscape includes special paving materials and patterns.\n(ii)\tLandscape beds and trees consistent with Subsection 9-14-11(b), \"Street Yard Design,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(iii)\tSeating and amenities consistent with Subsection 9-14-11(b), \"Street Yard Design,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(2)\tStreetscape Plaza. Streetscape plazas shall meet the following requirements:\n(A)\tThe streetscape plaza is located within the maximum setback.\n(B)\tAt least thirty-five percent of the streetwall fronts one or more streetwall plazas extending from the right-of-way to the maximum setback.\n(C)\tThe minimum width of each streetscape plaza along the frontage is 20 feet.\n(D)\tThe streetscape plaza is designed to integrate with the street yard and streetscape design and includes the following:\n(i)\tHardscape in the plaza includes special paving materials and patterns.\n(ii)\tLandscape beds and trees are provided consistent with the requirements of Subsection 9-14-11(b), \"Street Yard Design,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(iii)\tSeating and amenities are provided consistent with the requirements of Subsection 9-14-11(b), \"Street Yard Design,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(i)\tTerminated Vistas. Street terminates or curves on or adjacent to a property as designated on the regulating plan, the site or building design shall include a feature to terminate the view from the street or path. The project shall meet the following standards:\n(1)\tOpen Space. If the property where the vista is required to be terminated is open space, one of the outdoor space types established in Section 9-14-12, \"Outdoor Space Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981, shall be utilized, and a vertical feature shall terminate the view. Acceptable vertical features include, but are not limited to, a stand or grid of at least three large maturing trees, listed in the approved tree list published annually by the city manager, a sculpture, a gazebo, or a fountain.\n(2)\tBuilding. If the property where the vista is required to be terminated is not utilized as open space, the facade of a building shall terminate the view. At the termination point designated on the regulating plan, a minimum of sixty feet of the building facade shall meet the standards applicable to a Type A frontage, whether or not fronting on a Type A street, with the exception of the entrance requirements. The building shall include a feature that terminates the view, such as, a tower, cupola, bay, courtyard, or a streetscape plaza consistent with the streetwall variation requirements in Section 9-14-14(h), B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tParking or Other Facades. A parking structure, surface parking lot, or side or rear facade shall not terminate a vista.\n(j)\tTrash and Recycling Areas. Unless otherwise allowed by the building type, all trash, recycling, and other waste areas shall be located inside the building or in the parking yard consistent with the following requirements:\n(1)\tInterior of the Building. Refuse, recycling, and other waste areas located inside the building shall meet the following requirements:\n(A)\tAccess doors to the area shall be located on the rear or interior side facade.\n(B)\tIf no rear or interior side facade exists, access doors may be located off a Type B or C street facade.\n(C)\tAccess doors or gates on a street facade shall have a minimum opacity of 80 percent.\n(D)\tAccess gates shall be set back a minimum of five feet from any street facade.\n(2)\tOther Locations. When no parking yard exists, the parking or rear yard is less than ten feet in depth, and an interior building location is not available, trash, recycling, and other waste areas may be located in the rear yard, interior side yard, or in a Type B or C street yard.\n(k)\tGarage Entrances. Garage doors shall be located on a Type B frontage, Type C frontage, rear or interior yard, or along an interior side facade, except that on the service base garage doors may also be located consistent with the standards in Section 9-14-24, \"Service Base,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(1)\tGarage doors on Type B frontages shall be set back from the majority of the frontage facade a minimum of three feet.\n(2)\tGarage doors on Type B frontages shall meet minimum facade transparency requirements unless art is incorporated into the door.\n(l)\tLoading Locations. All on-site loading areas shall be located in the rear or interior yard for all building types, except that on the service base on-site loading areas may also be located consistent with the standards in Section 9-14-24, B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance Nos. 8669 (2025); 8697 (2025)"

The minimum percentage of building facade along the Type A frontage of a lot is measured as follows:\n(1)\tMeasurement. The minimum Type A frontage streetwall shall, at a minimum, equal the width of the principal structures, as measured within the minimum and maximum setback along the frontage, divided by the length of the frontage parallel to the property line following the street minus setbacks along perpendicular property lines. Refer to Figure 14-51. Minimum Type A Frontage Streetwall.\n(2)\tCourtyards. For some building types, courtyards located along the facade in the frontage setback count towards the minimum coverage. Refer to building type requirements of Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tOutdoor Space Type. Open spaces meeting the requirements of one of the outdoor space types established in this chapter are exempt from the minimum Type A frontage streetwall requirement.\nFigure 14-51. Minimum Type A Frontage Streetwall\n(b)\tFrontage Setback. The minimum to maximum frontage setback shall be calculated and measured as follows. Refer to Figure 14-52. Frontage Setbacks.\n(1)\tMeasurement. If the frontage is a Type A, B, or C frontage along a transportation improvement or waterway, the minimum and maximum frontage setbacks are measured from the outside edge of an easement for the transportation improvement or waterway, or, if no easement exists, from the parcel or lot line abutting the transportation improvement or waterway, as applicable. If the frontage is along a required outdoor space, the minimum and maximum frontage setbacks are measured from the outside edge of an easement for the outdoor space, or, if no easement exists, from the parcel or lot line abutting to the outdoor space, or if not within a separate parcel or lot, from the outer edge of the outdoor space as delineated on the site plan.\n(2)\tHeight. All building facades located within the frontage setback shall meet the minimum building height of the building.\n(3)\tEncroachments. Awnings, architectural projections, balconies, and building mounted signage may extend beyond the frontage setback into any yard area but shall not extend into the street right-of-way or public easement unless approved with a revocable permit or lease, as applicable.\nFigure 14-52. Frontage Setbacks\n(c)\tLimited Side Yard Parking. Where allowed by building type, parking may be located in the interior side yard, consistent with the following requirements:\n(1)\tThe limited side yard parking lot is located fully in an interior side yard.\n(2)\tThe limited side yard parking is configured as one double- or one single-loaded aisle of parking and the centerline of the aisle is located perpendicular to the street.\n(3)\tThe limited side yard parking is not located on corners in any street yard.\n(4)\tNo more than one limited side yard parking lot per building is located along any street frontage.\n(5)\tThe limited side yard parking lots is not located next to another limited side yard parking lot.\n(d)\tMaximum Impervious and Additional Semi-Pervious Coverage. Impervious and additional semi-pervious coverage shall be calculated and measured as follows. Refer to Figure 14-53. Impervious and Semi-Pervious Coverage.\n(1)\tMaximum Impervious Coverage. The maximum impervious coverage is the maximum percentage of a lot permitted to be covered by structures, pavement, and other impervious surfaces.\n(2)\tAdditional Semi-Pervious Coverage. In addition to the allowable impervious coverage on a site, a maximum amount of additional semi-pervious coverage is permitted.\nFigure 14-53. Impervious and Semi-Pervious Coverage\n(e)\tOverall Minimum and Maximum Height. (Refer to Figure 14-54. Measuring Stories with Floor-to-Floor Height.)\n(1)\tMinimum Overall Height. Each building type requires a minimum number of stories. The building must meet the minimum required height along all Type A frontage facades and measured a minimum of thirty feet deep into the building.\n(2)\tMaximum Overall Height. Maximum heights are specified both in number of stories and overall dimension. This requirement applies to the entire building.\n(A)\tTowers. Where specifically allowed in the building type tables, Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, towers may exceed the overall maximum height of the building type per subsection (f) of Section 9-14-25, \"Cap Types,\" B.R.C. 1981. Towers shall not exceed the maximum height per section 84 of the charter of the City of Boulder.\n(B)\tCap Type. Where specified in subsection (f) of Section 9-14-25, \"Cap Types,\" B.R.C. 1981, certain cap types may allow additional height.\n(C)\tMaximum Heights per the City Charter. Under no circumstances may any building or structure exceed the height limitations established in section 84 of the charter of the City of Boulder.\n(D)\tHeight Measurement Standards. Height shall be measured consistent with height measurement standards of Section 9-7-5, \"Building Height,\" B.R.C. 1981, and the definition of \"height\" within Section 9-16-1, \"General Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(E)\tView Corridors. Height is subject to additional limitations where maximum heights are restricted pursuant to the regulating plan to preserve a view corridor. Refer to Sections 9-14-6, \"Regulating Plans,\" and 9-14-7, \"View Corridors,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tTwo Half Stories. If a building has both a half story within the roof and a half story that is partially above and partially below grade, the combined height of the two half stories shall be considered one full story.\n(f)\tMinimum and Maximum Height per Story. Each story is measured with a range of permitted floor-to-floor heights. Refer to Figure 14-54. Measuring Stories with Floor-to-Floor Height.\n(1)\tMeasurement. Story height shall be measured in feet between the floor of a story to the floor of the story above it. Minimum and maximum floor-to-floor heights are required to be met along facades for a minimum of eighty percent of each story.\n(2)\tSingle Story Buildings and Top Story Measurement. For single story buildings and the uppermost story of a multiple story building, the minimum floor-to-floor height shall be one foot less than that required per building type. The measurement shall be from the floor of the story to the ceiling.\n(3)\tMezzanines. Mezzanines may be included within the floor-to-floor height of any story. Mezzanines occupying more than thirty percent of the floor area below and extending above the story's allowable floor-to-floor height shall count as an additional story and shall meet transparency requirements in subsection (e)(5), below.\n(4)\tTaller Spaces. Spaces exceeding the allowable floor-to-floor heights of the building type are permitted on any facade. On Type A and B frontage facades, the taller space is limited to no more than 35% of the length of the façade or 35 feet, whichever is less. Taller spaces may not exceed the total height of the surrounding stories, and the façade meet the transparency requirements of the surrounding stories.\nFigure 14-54. Measuring Stories with Floor-to-Floor Height\n(g)\tMinimum Required Transparency. Per the requirements of each building type, a minimum amount of transparency is required on all stories of street, courtyard, and public way facades. The following applies to transparency requirements:\n(1)\tMeasurement. Minimum facade transparency is measured from floor-to-floor of each story separately, except for required minimum ground story transparency (refer to Paragraph 9-14-26(g)(4), B.R.C. 1981, below). Refer to Figure 14-55. Measuring Minimum Facade Transparency. Transparency requirements shall be met with windows or glass in doors meeting the standards for transparency as defined in Section 9-14-8, \"Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981. The measurement may include the frame, mullions, and muntins, but shall not include trim or casing.\nFigure 14-55. Measuring Minimum Facade Transparency\n(2)\tBlank Wall Limitations. Refer to Figure 14-56. Measuring Blank Wall Limitations.\n(A)\tIntent. The intent of the blank wall limitations is to avoid long stretches of blank walls, distribute transparency within a story, and ensure that windows are located at the height of a person standing within the story.\n(B)\tWhere the building type standards impose blank wall limitations, the following applies:\n(i)\tNo rectangular area greater than thirty percent of the story's facade, as measured floor to floor, shall be without transparency. Refer to Figure 14-56. Measuring Blank Wall Limitations.\n(ii)\tNo horizontal segment of a story's facade greater than fifteen feet in width shall be without transparency. Refer to Figure 14-56. Measuring Blank Wall Limitations.\nFigure 14-56. Measuring Blank Wall Limitations\n(3)\tException. When the facade of any story is located less than six feet from another parallel building facade, no minimum transparency is required for that story.\n(4)\tMinimum Ground Story Transparency. When required by the building type tables of Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, ground story transparency shall be measured between two feet and either eight or ten feet, as specified per building type, from the average grade at the base of the facade. The minimum ground story transparency requirements supersede the minimum transparency required for the building type.\n(5)\tMezzanines. Mezzanines shall be treated as a separate story and include the required upper story transparency amounts.\n(6)\tTall Stories. Stories that are eighteen feet or taller in height shall include additional transparency consistent with the following standards. Refer to Figure 14-57. Transparency on Tall Stories.\n(A)\tSeparate Ground Story Transparency Required. When a separate minimum ground story transparency is required per the building types requirements of Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, the facade design shall fulfill that requirement in addition to a minimum of twenty-five percent transparency for the remainder of the ground story.\n(B)\tNo Separate Ground Story Transparency Required. Except on a ground story facade to which a Type A frontage ground story facade transparency requirement applies, a tall story shall be treated as two separate stories, divided in half horizontally, with the minimum transparency per story applied to each half.\n(7)\tHalf Stories. All half stories located within the roof structure and within visible basements are required to meet the minimum required transparency.\nFigure 14-57. Transparency on Tall Stories\n(h)\tMinimum Number of Required Entrances. Entrances shall be provided consistent with the entrance location and number requirements established for the building type and consistent with Figure 14-58.

The intent of the requirements in Sections 9-14-27 through 9-14-33, B.R.C. 1981, is to implement the vision for the area as defined in adopted plans for the area, create a sense of place and community, elicit simple, honest, high quality, durable buildings of appropriate scale and massing that are visually interesting, aesthetically pleasing, create a sense of permanence, and are human scaled to enhance the pedestrian experience.\n(1)\tSimple. Simple means the building design is organized and easy-to-comprehend through the use of repetition, regularity, and a clear hierarchy.\n(2)\tHonest. Honest means the building is easily interpreted by the casual observer. Entrances, floors, and building use are apparent and the form of the building follows the function. The overall bulk and mass of the building clearly represents the structure, spatial layout, and materiality.\n(3)\tHuman-Scaled. Human-scaled means the buildings are scaled to proportions comfortable to people. Typically, human-scaled buildings have smaller building material units, architectural detailing to accentuate building elements, and a predictable rhythm to the facade pattern. This design approach is used particularly on the ground story where people walk adjacent to the building.\n(b)\tApplicability. The requirements of Sections 9-14-27 through 9-14-33, B.R.C. 1981, establish general building design requirements applicable to all buildings located on a property designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" regardless of the building type. No person shall use or develop land in such areas except in conformance with the requirements of Sections 9-14-27 through 9-14-33, B.R.C. 1981, unless an exception has been granted pursuant to Subsection 9-2-16(i), B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance No. 8669 (2025)"
