    "verbatim": "6-1-1. Legislative Intent and Purpose.\n(a)\tThe purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city by prescribing the types of animals that can be kept in the city and the conditions under which they can be kept, limitations on keeping animals that create a nuisance by being safety or health hazards, and the procedures by which the city manager or an authorized agent may impound and dispose of animals kept in violation of the chapter.\n(b)\tThe city council intends to protect persons and property in the city from animals running at large and to abrogate the requirements of the Colorado fence law.\n(c)\tNotwithstanding the use of words such as guardian, keeper, owner, or title in this chapter, the city council intends to reflect the common law view that the property rights of owners in their animals are qualified by the city's exercise of its police power over such animals, and that summary impoundments and dispositions of animals are two such qualifications of such rights.\n(d)\tFurther purposes of this chapter are to:\n(1)\tProtect unique elements of the local environment;\n(2)\tProtect biodiversity and overall health of natural ecosystems within this community;\n(3)\tRecognize the important contribution of wildlife to the local environment;\n(4)\tAdvance local community values by encouraging humane means of wildlife control;\n(5)\tAvoid collateral harm to wildlife that is protected under state, federal, and local law;\n(6)\tManage conflicts between wildlife and human land uses;\n(7)\tFoster preservation of animal and bird species native to the local community; and\n(8)\tLegislate in a manner that satisfies important issues of local concern while also being consistent with applicable state and federal regulations.\n(e)\tThe following priorities shall guide the city's policies and regulations with regard to the interface between people and wildlife:\n(1)\tEfforts should be made to minimize conflicts between human beings and wildlife;\n(2)\tWhen unsustainable conflicts between wildlife and human beings exist on a particular property, efforts should be made, where appropriate, to maintain wildlife on portions of such property in order to minimize such conflicts;\n(3)\tWhere resolution of conflicts between human uses and wildlife habitat cannot be achieved on a particular property, relocation alternatives should be explored and encouraged;\n(4)\tWhere relocation alternatives are not feasible, capture and transportation of wildlife for use in animal recovery programs should be explored and encouraged;\n(5)\tWhere lethal control measures for wildlife are required, the use of live trapping and individual euthanization should be considered and encouraged in order to minimize suffering;\n(6)\tWhen lethal control measures are employed, action should be taken to mitigate the negative community-wide impacts associated with the loss of local wildlife and wildlife habitat; and\n(7)\tWhen lethal control measures are utilized, notice should be provided to the city manager so that habitat preservation and environmental impacts can be monitored.\n(f)\tThe city intends to exercise its legislative authority and power to require action in compliance with this chapter by landowners, residents, visitors, employers, and employees pursuant to its local home rule authority. To the extent any landowner is a person permitted by the State of Colorado to use pesticides, this chapter shall not be construed to regulate that person's handling, mixing, loading, application, administration, control, or disposal of a pesticide or its container, and shall be construed only to regulate land use and the management of wildlife on local land.\n(g)\tThe city council finds that the regulation of local wildlife, wildlife habitat, and any conflicts between human land uses and local wildlife constitutes an area of valid local concern and regulation and is therefore subject to the valid exercise of the city's police power. The various provisions of this chapter bearing upon those subjects reflect an appropriate exercise of the city's police powers, except to the extent that any such provision may be contradicted and overridden by a controlling provision of state law.\n(h)\tThe city council finds that the use of poison to control wildlife is having an adverse and cumulative effect upon the local environment, and upon the health and safety of human beings and local wildlife. Residents and visitors to the city are urged to avoid using poisons as a mechanism for wildlife control, especially when other less ecologically damaging control strategies are available.\nOrdinance Nos. 4935 (1985); 7321 (2005)"

If the adoption agency determines that it is medically inadvisable to spay or neuter the dog or cat before the time of adoption, the adoption agency shall enter into a conditional contract of sale, on a form approved by the city manager, which shall provide, without limitation, that the adopter is given temporary custody of the animal, but title to the animal remains in the city until a date certain. If the affidavit of a veterinarian that the animal has been spayed or neutered is not delivered to the adoption agency on or before such date, the adopter shall surrender the animal to the adoption agency on or before such date and shall be subject to prosecution for failure to do so.\n(f)\tIf, in the opinion of a veterinarian, or the animal shelter supervisor, if a veterinarian is not available, a pet animal is experiencing extreme pain or suffering, the city manager may euthanize the animal as soon as the manager has exhausted reasonable efforts to contact the owner, but if the animal has identification, the animal shall not be euthanized for twenty-four hours.\nOrdinance Nos. 4935 (1985); 5377 (1991); 7326 (2003)"

This chapter also regulates access of minors to tobacco products.\nIn addition, the city council finds that electronic smoking devices are battery operated devices designed to deliver nicotine, cannabis, flavor, and/or other substances through a vapor inhaled by the user and that use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly in recent years. The city council further finds that electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional smoking products in shape, size, and color, with the user exhaling a smoke-like vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional smoking products.\nCity Council finds that the use of electronic smoking devices in smoke-free locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment.\nTherefore, the purpose of this chapter is also to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by discouraging the use of electronic smoking devices around non-users, especially children; by protecting the public from exposure to secondhand byproducts of electronic smoking devices where they live, work, and play; by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smoke-free air laws; by reducing the potential for re-normalizing smoking in public places and places of employment; and by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle.\nOrdinance Nos. 7650 (2009); 8015 (2015); 8548 (2023)"

The city council finds that such adoption will decrease the extreme risk to public health and safety posed by the transportation of hazardous material and hazardous waste in the city and promote more effective enforcement by creating such a capability at the local level."

Any reduction in the release of said materials within the city will not only reduce the global danger, but will also benefit the city by reducing the long-term danger to human health, life and the environment associated with such releases.\n(g)\tThe city council finds that chlorofluorocarbons are widely used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems and that the recapturing and recycling of chlorofluorocarbons from auto air conditioning units could eliminate approximately twenty percent of all chlorofluorocarbons released in the United States.\n(h)\tIt is the intent of the city council to encourage the research and development of environmentally safe alternative technologies and products to replace the use of chlorofluorocarbons and halons.\n(i)\tIt is the intent of the city council to support the adoption of international, national and state bans on the use of chlorofluorocarbons; however, until such bans have been adopted by the appropriate agencies, responsible action on the part of the city is necessary to reduce chlorofluorocarbon and halon use in order to promote the long-term health, safety and welfare of the general public and the environment."

    "verbatim": "6-14-1. Legislative Intent and Purpose.\n(a)\tLegislative Intent. The city council intends to regulate the use, acquisition, cultivation, production, and distribution of medical marijuana in a manner that is consistent with Article XVIII, Section 14 of the Colorado Constitution (the \"Medical Marijuana Amendment\").\n(1)\tThe Medical Marijuana Amendment to the Colorado Constitution does not provide a legal manner for patients to obtain medical marijuana unless the patient grows the marijuana or the marijuana is grown by the patient's primary caregiver. The regulations are intended to apply to all medical marijuana operations in the city whether by a patient or caregiver under the Medical Marijuana Amendment, or any medical marijuana business permitted under the state law. Medical marijuana cultivation and production can have an impact on health, safety, and community resources, and the Code is intended to permit medical marijuana cultivation where it will have a minimal impact.\n(2)\tUse, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and transportation of medical marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and marijuana remains classified as a \"controlled substance\" by federal law.\n(3)\tThe regulations for medical marijuana uses are not adequate at the state level to address the impacts on the city of medical marijuana, making it appropriate for local regulation of the impacts of medical marijuana uses.\n(4)\tNothing in this chapter is intended to promote or condone the production, distribution, or possession of marijuana in violation of any applicable law.\n(5)\tThis chapter is to be construed to protect the public over medical marijuana business interests. Operation of a medical marijuana business is a revocable privilege and not a right in the city. There is no property right for an individual or business to have medical marijuana in the city.\n(6)\tMedical marijuana is a heavily regulated industry in the city, all licensees are assumed to be fully aware of the law, the city shall not therefore be required to issue warnings before issuing citations for violations of this chapter.\n(b)\tPurpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents and patients of the city by prescribing the manner in which medical marijuana businesses can be conducted in the city. Further, the purpose of this chapter is to:\n(1)\tProvide for a means of cultivation, production, and distribution of marijuana to patients who qualify to obtain, possess, and use marijuana for medical purposes under the Medical Marijuana Amendment.\n(2)\tProtect public health and safety through reasonable limitations on business operations as they relate to noise, air and water quality, food safety, neighborhood and patient safety, security for the business and its personnel, and other health and safety concerns.\n(3)\tPromote lively street life and high quality neighborhoods by limiting the concentration of any one type of business in specific areas.\n(4)\tImpose fees to cover the cost to the city of licensing medical marijuana businesses in an amount sufficient for the city to recover its costs of the licensing program.\n(5)\tAdopt a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this chapter.\n(6)\tCreate regulations that address the particular needs of the patients and residents of the city and coordinate with laws that may be enacted by the state regarding the issue.\n(7)\tFacilitate the implementation of the Medical Marijuana Amendment without going beyond the authority granted by it.\n(8)\tSupport Boulder's Sustainability and Climate Action Plan goals by requiring renewable sources for energy use to grow medical marijuana.\n(9)\tIssue medical marijuana business licenses only to individuals and entities that have demonstrated an intent and ability to comply with this chapter without monitoring by city officials.\n(10)\tProtect public safety and residential areas by limiting the areas of the city where more than six medical marijuana plants may be grown.\n(11)\tExclude from the definition of a medical marijuana business the private possession, production, and medical use of marijuana by an individual patient or the private possession, production, distribution, and medical use of marijuana by an individual caregiver for one patient, in the residence of the patient or caregiver, to the extent permitted by Article XVIII, Section 14 of the Colorado Constitution.\n(c)\tRelationship to State Law. The provisions in this chapter that are different from the state law are consistent with the city's responsibility to protect the public health, safety, and welfare as authorized by § 12-43.3-305, C.R.S., and by the home rule authority granted to the city by Article XX of the Colorado Constitution and the charter of the city. The city intends that both state law and this chapter apply within the city. Where this chapter conflicts with the state law, this chapter shall apply on all matters authorized in § 12-43.3-101, et seq., C.R.S., and all matters of local concern.\n(d)\tAdoption of this chapter is not intended to waive or otherwise impair any portion of the local option available under § 12-43.3-106, C.R.S.\nOrdinance Nos. 7716 (2010); 7780 (2011); 7877 (2012); 7929 (2013); 8081 (2015)"

Such fee is nonrefundable.\n(2)\tIn the event there has been a change to any of the plans identified in the license application which were submitted to and approved by the city with the application or an earlier renewal, the renewal application shall include specifics of the changes or proposed changes in any of such plans.\n(3)\tIn the event any person who has an interest as described in the disclosures made to the city pursuant to this chapter, or any keyholder, financier, agent as defined herein, or employee has been charged with or accused of violations of any law since such disclosure, the renewal application shall include the name of the violator, the date of the violation, the court and case number where the violation was filed, and the disposition of the violation with the renewal application.\n(4)\tIn the event the business license has been suspended or revoked or a licensee has received any notice of violation of any law, the renewal application shall include a copy of the notice, suspension, or revocation.\n(5)\tThe renewal application shall include: (i) verification that the business has a valid state license and the state license is in good standing; and (ii) a list from the licensee of the city approved keyholders who are employed at the licensed location to be renewed.\n(6)\tThe renewal application shall include a summary report for the previous twelve months showing the amount of marijuana purchased, the amount of marijuana sold, the forms in which marijuana was sold, the number of patients and the number of primary caregivers who received marijuana, the police report numbers or case numbers of all police calls to the medical marijuana business and, for calls resulting in a charge of a violation of any law, the charge, case number, and disposition of any of the charges.\n(7)\tThe city shall not accept renewal applications after the expiration of the license, but instead shall require the applicant to file a new license application.\n(8)\tIn the event there have been allegations of violations of this code by any of the licensees or the business submitting a renewal application, the city may hold a hearing pursuant to Chapter 1-3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981, prior to approving the renewal application. The hearing shall be to determine whether the application and proposed licensees comply with this chapter and whether the operation of the business has been in compliance with this code. If the city does not hold a hearing and the application and the licensees do not meet the requirements of this chapter, or the business has been operated in the past in violation of this code, the renewal application may be denied or issued with conditions, and the decision shall be final subject to judicial review as provided in Subsection 6-14-4(e).\n(c)\tNonpayment of Tax.

The city council intends to regulate the use, possession, cultivation, production, and distribution of marijuana in a manner that is consistent with Article XVIII, Section 16 of the Colorado Constitution (the \"Recreational Marijuana Amendment\" also known as Amendment 64) and finds that the provisions of this chapter are directly and demonstrably related to the operation of marijuana establishments in a manner to minimize negative impacts on the community.\n(1)\tThe city adopts this law to apply to all recreational marijuana operations in the city under the Recreational Marijuana Amendment, or any recreational marijuana business permitted under the state law.\n(2)\tMarijuana use, distribution, cultivation, and production can have an impact on health, safety, and community resources, and the code is intended to permit marijuana cultivation, distribution, production, and testing where it will have a minimal impact, and potential negative impacts are minimized.\n(3)\tUse, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and transportation of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and marijuana remains classified as a \"Level 1 Controlled Substance\" by federal law.\n(4)\tThe General Assembly has adopted enabling legislation that provides for local licensing, however, the state law is not intended to, and does not, address the local impacts of marijuana operations, making it appropriate for local regulation of marijuana operations.\n(5)\tNothing in this chapter is intended to promote or condone the production, distribution, or possession of marijuana in violation of any applicable law.\n(6)\tThis chapter is to be construed to protect the public over marijuana business interests. Operation of a recreational marijuana business is a revocable privilege and not a right in the city. There is no property right for an individual or business to have marijuana in the city.\n(7)\tMarijuana businesses are a heavily regulated industry in the city, all licensees are assumed to be fully aware of the law, the city shall not therefore be required to issue warnings before issuing citations for violations of this chapter.\n(8)\tThis chapter is not intended to replace the medical marijuana law in Chapter 6-14, \"Medical Marijuana,\" B.R.C. 1981, and any person may apply for and operate a medical marijuana business pursuant to Chapter 6-14, \"Medical Marijuana,\" B.R.C. 1981, without complying with this chapter.\n(9)\tThis chapter is intended to specify the time, place, and manner restrictions for operating a recreational marijuana business in the city as specified in the Recreational Marijuana Amendment.\n(10)\tThe operation of a marijuana business without a license from the city as provided in this chapter is prohibited within the city.\n(11)\tThe experience of the city in processing and enforcing medical marijuana business licensing evidences that the provisions herein are capable and worthy of being carried out in practice by a reasonably prudent businessperson.\n(12)\tThe Colorado Administrative Procedures Act, Article 4 of Title 24 of the Colorado Revised Statutes (the \"APA\"), does not apply to local governments and the state has not been able to resource the process thereof in a timely manner. The procedures herein for issuance and enforcement of a recreational marijuana business license are consistent with the requirements of the APA and have been determined by the Boulder District Court to provide the level of due process required by the United States and Colorado Constitutions.\n(13)\tA licensee is not acting in his or her capacity as an owner, employee, or agent of a licensed marijuana establishment if the licensee is operating in violation of this chapter or any other applicable law.\n(14)\tThe city council has determined to allow marijuana establishments in the city on the condition that the establishments are operated in compliance with this chapter rather than banning marijuana establishments in the city as permitted by the Recreational Marijuana Amendment.\n(b)\tPurpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents, businesses, and property in the city by prescribing the manner in which recreational marijuana businesses can be conducted in the city. Further, the purpose of this chapter is to:\n(1)\tProvide for a means of cultivation, production, and distribution of marijuana to persons permitted to obtain, possess, and use marijuana for recreational purposes under the Recreational Marijuana Amendment;\n(2)\tProtect public health and safety through reasonable limitations on business operations as they relate to noise, air, and water quality, food safety, neighborhood and public safety, security for the business and its personnel, and other health and safety concerns;\n(3)\tPromote lively street life and high quality neighborhoods by limiting the concentration of any one type of business in specific areas;\n(4)\tImpose fees for licensing recreational marijuana businesses in an amount sufficient for the city to recover its costs of the licensing program;\n(5)\tAdopt a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this chapter;\n(6)\tCreate regulations that address the particular needs of the residents and businesses of the city and coordinate with laws that may be enacted by the State of Colorado regarding recreational marijuana;\n(7)\tFacilitate the implementation of the Recreational Marijuana Amendment without going beyond the authority granted by it;\n(8)\tSupport Boulder's Sustainability and Climate Action Plan goals by requiring renewable sources for energy use to grow recreational marijuana;\n(9)\tIssue recreational marijuana business licenses only to individuals and entities that have demonstrated an intent and ability to comply with this chapter without monitoring by city officials;\n(10)\tProtect public safety and residential areas by limiting the areas of the city where more than six marijuana plants may be grown;\n(11)\tExclude from the definition of arecreational marijuana business the private possession, production, and recreational use of marijuana by an individual or the private possession, production, distribution, and recreational use of marijuana by an individual, in the person's residence, to the extent permitted by Article XVIII, Section 16 of the Colorado Constitution; and\n(12)\tDesignate the city manager as the recreational marijuana licensing authority responsible for licensing recreational marijuana for the city.\n(c)\tRelationship to State Law. The provisions in this chapter that are different from the applicable state law are consistent with the city's responsibility to protect the public health, safety, and welfare as authorized by applicable law, and by the home rule authority granted to the city by Article XX of the Colorado Constitution and the Charter of the city. The city intends that both state law and this chapter apply within the city. Where this chapter conflicts with the state law, this chapter shall apply.\n(d)\tAdoption of this chapter is not intended to waive or otherwise impair any portion of the local option available under the Recreational Marijuana Amendment.\nOrdinance No. 7930 (2013); 8081 (2015)"

By applying for a recreational marijuana business license, the licensee is providing consent to disclose the information required by this chapter. Any document that the applicant considers eligible for protection under the Colorado Open Records Act shall be clearly marked as confidential, and the reasons for such confidentiality shall be stated on the document. In the event that the licensee does appropriately submit documents so as not to be disclosed under the Colorado Open Records Act, the city shall not disclose it to other parties who are not agents of the city, except law enforcement agencies. If the city finds that such documents are subject to inspection as public records of the city, it will attempt to provide at least twenty-four-hour notice to the applicant prior to such disclosure.\n(d)\tAudits. The city may require an audit to be made of the books of account and records of a recreational marijuana business on such occasions as it may consider necessary. Such audit may be made by an auditor to be selected by the city that shall likewise have access to all books and records of the recreational marijuana business. The expense of any audit determined necessary by the city shall be paid by the recreational marijuana business.\n(e)\tConsent to Inspection. Application for a recreational marijuana business license or operation of a recreational marijuana business, or leasing property to a recreational marijuana business, constitutes consent by the applicant, and all owners, managers, and employees of the business, and the owner of the property, to permit the city manager to conduct routine inspections of the recreational marijuana business to ensure compliance with this chapter or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation. The owner or keyholder on duty shall retrieve and provide the records of the business pertaining to the inspection, including the security tapes from the cameras required by the security plan. For purposes of Rule 241 of the Colorado Rules of Municipal Procedure and Subsection 2-6-3(e) of this code, inspections of recreational marijuana businesses and recordings from security cameras in such businesses are part of the routine policy of inspection and enforcement of this chapter for the purpose of protecting the public safety, individuals operating and using the services of the recreational marijuana business, and the adjoining properties and neighborhood, as provided in Section 6-14-1, \"Legislative Intent and Purpose,\" B.R.C. 1981.

Recreational marijuana businesses shall maintain records showing compliance with the renewable energy requirements in this chapter.\nOrdinance No. 7930 (2013); 8081 (2015); 8157 (2016); 8240 (2018); 8307 (2019)"
