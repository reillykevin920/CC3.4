No more than two resident permits shall be in effect at any time for any person. No person shall be deemed a resident of more than one zone, and no more than one permit may be issued for any one vehicle even if persons residing in different zones share ownership or use.\n(d)\tResident permits issued under this section shall be specific for a single vehicle, shall not be transferred except as provided by city manager rule or regulation, and shall be displayed thereon or, for digital permits, valid and in effect only as the manager by regulation may prescribe. The permittee shall remove the permit from the vehicle or otherwise cancel the permit if the vehicle is sold, leased or no longer in the custody of the permittee.\n(e)\tBusiness Permits. Business, for the purpose of this chapter, includes nonresidential institutions, but does not include home occupations. Three business employee permits may be in effect at any time for any business without regard to number of employees or off-street parking. In the alternative, upon application by the manager of the business, the city manager may issue employee permits to a business according to the following formula: half of the number of full-time equivalent employees minus the number of off-street parking spaces under the control of the business at that location equals the maximum number of employee permits for the business. Full-time equivalent employees of the business are calculated based upon one such employee for every full forty hours worked at that location by employees of the business within the periods of time in a week during which the neighborhood permit parking restrictions are in effect. On its application, the employer shall designate the employee vehicles, not to exceed the number allowed, for which each permit is valid. A business permit is valid only for the vehicles listed thereon, and shall be displayed on the vehicle for which the permit is being used only as the manager by regulation may prescribe.\n(f)\tThe manager shall by regulation set forth how long permits issued under this section are valid and when they must be renewed.\n(g)\tIn considering applications for resident permits, the manager may require proof that the applicant has a legal right to possession of the premises claimed as a residence. If the manager has probable cause to believe that the occupancy limitations of Subsection 9-8-5(a), B.R.C. 1981, are being violated, no further permits shall be issued under this section for the residence in question until the occupancy thereof is brought into compliance.\n(h)\tIf a physical permit or the portion of the vehicle to which a resident permit has been affixed is damaged such that it must be replaced, the permittee, upon application therefor, shall be issued a replacement at a prorated cost. The manager may require display of the damaged permit before a new permit is issued.\n(i)\tNo person shall use or display any permit issued under this section in violation of any provision of this code.\n(j)\tCommuter Permits. The maximum number of nonresident permits issued on any given block face within a zone shall be four. In addition, if the manager determines that the average daily percentage of unoccupied neighborhood parking spaces, on block faces where commuter permits have been allocated, drops below twenty-five percent for four consecutive hours between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. of any given weekday, then the manager shall reduce the number of commuter permits by a number estimated to maintain an average daily percentage of unoccupied neighborhood parking spaces of twenty-five percent. But for any part of Goss Street or Circle, Grove Street or Circle or the portions of 16th Street through 23rd Street between Arapahoe Avenue and Canyon Boulevard, included within any neighborhood parking permit zone, the average daily percentage of unoccupied neighborhood parking spaces which must be maintained without reduction in commuter permits shall be fifteen percent. The manager may also, for this Goss-Grove zone, allocate commuter permits initially to educational institutions and organizations representing postal workers in rough proportion to the needs of these groups. Such groups may renew such permits. Distribution of such permits by such groups to their clientele shall be at a price not to exceed the cost of the permit.\nOrdinance Nos. 5271 (1990); 7004 (1999); 7243 (2002); 7247 (2002); 7569 (2007); 7879 (2012); 8119 (2017); 8509 (2021); 8642 (2024); 8651 (2025)"

No person engaged in a burial, reburial, or disinterment pursuant to a permit issued by the manager shall fail to insure that all the work complies with all of the requirements of this section and any other applicable law.\n(b)\tPermits shall be issued or denied by the manager based on the following standards:\n(1)\tForty-eight hours' advance notice of interment is required during the normal working week (Monday through Friday, holidays excepted). Notification of a pending Monday morning interment must be given by 2 p.m. Friday.\n(2)\tThe application for an interment must specify the exact location on the lot of the grave to be opened. When instructions regarding the location of a grave on a lot are indefinite, or for any reason the grave cannot be opened where specified, the mortuary may, with the approval of the city manager, open the grave on the lot where it deems best and proper, so as not to delay the funeral; and the city shall not be liable in damages for any error so made.\n(3)\tThe grave shall be of such depth that there shall be no less than thirty inches of distance from the uppermost surface of the outer burial container to adjacent ground elevation. However, if large rocks are encountered which cannot reasonably be removed, this depth may be reduced the minimum amount necessary to deal with the rocks, but in no case shall the depth be less than eighteen inches.\n(4)\tAll burials shall be made in such a way that there will be no settlement due to caskets, vaults, or other containers having insufficient strength to support, through intermediate tamped fill, normal mechanized cemetery maintenance equipment. Topsoil replaced around and on top of containers shall be tamped sufficiently to assure minimal settling. Original or new lawn grass sod shall be placed over the soil fill in such a manner that, after normal settling, the grave surface shall be level with adjacent ground. Excess soil shall be neatly removed from the cemetery premises.\n(5)\tNo new plantings (other than sod), flowerbeds, or additional shrubbery shall be permitted on grave spaces as part of interment.\n(6)\tThe city manager may refuse interment in any grave space, and refuse to open or allow to be opened any grave for any purpose, unless a written deed is presented to show proper ownership of the grave space. If a deed is not available, then some other evidence must be presented to the city manager to establish ownership. Such evidence must show the section, lot, and grave space number. The city does not assume liability should the wrong grave space be opened and used.\n(c)\tUpon receipt of an application for interment, the city manager shall determine if the grave may be dug using machinery. Graves may normally be dug using machinery except in instances where the city manager deems that the use of machinery or equipment will cause significant damage to turf, grounds, individual lots, landscaping, walks, grave spaces, grave markers, or other property in the cemetery. If the use of machinery will cause significant damage, the city manager may require the applicant either to hand dig the grave, use plywood or other suitable material to protect the grounds, or wait until conditions are such that machinery may be used.\n(d)\tThe city manager may stop all work of any nature whenever proper preparations therefor have not been made, when tools or machinery are insufficient or defective, when work is being executed in such a manner as to threaten life or property, when any reasonable request on the part of the city manager has been disregarded, when work is not being executed in accordance with specifications, or when any person employed on the work violates any provision of the permit or law governing the cemetery.\n(e)\tThe completed work is subject to the approval of the city manager, and if unsatisfactory, it may be ordered to be removed by the manager at the permittee's sole expense, and no permittee shall fail to comply with such an order.\n(f)\tThere is no fee for an earth interment permit."

    "verbatim": "4-27-1. Legislative Intent.\n(a)\tNewspaper distribution machines (often called newspaper vending machines or news boxes) on or adjacent to public sidewalks are a valuable method of distributing news and other information to the public. However, they constitute a fixed physical intrusion on public property, and their indiscriminate location on sidewalks can unnecessarily obstruct the primary function of the sidewalk, which is to allow persons to go from one place to another. They also can constitute visual blight, and can be distracting to motorists and pedestrians, and in Boulder they have had all of these effects. Furthermore, no other commercial activity would claim a right to physical occupation of the public sidewalk by proprietary structures in an unregulated manner, and even public utilities which have a high degree of autonomy from local regulation still must not interfere with the primary functions of the streets and sidewalks for which they have easements, express or implied.\n(b)\tThe city has carefully regulated the placement and form of newspaper distribution machines on its downtown mall since its inception in 1977 by providing news box banks onto which publishers of newspapers and other periodicals may install an openable face plate and their periodicals. These serve to group the machines in a few orderly and carefully chosen locations, and this has struck an appropriate balance between the competing needs for use of mall space and has allowed mall visitors and those who would serve them with publications reasonable opportunities to receive and give information. However, the mall contains significantly more pedestrian space than do the other streets and sidewalks in the downtown area of the city. The continued vitality of the city's downtown area has made downtown sidewalks increasingly congested, and thus, attractive locations for those who wish to disseminate information through newspaper distribution machines. The legislative record is replete with instances where unregulated placement of these machines, whether individually or in long phalanxes, have interfered with access to fire hydrants and parking payment apparatus or technology, blocked access from vehicle parking to the sidewalk, interfered with bus stops, obstructed views in the corner sight triangle, and most poignantly have added to the difficulties that persons with mobility problems face in navigating the sidewalk. Further, significant portions of the downtown are within an historic district, and the unregulated placement and appearance of proprietary newspaper distribution machines interferes with the historic appearance of the area and the purposes of the district.\n(c)\tBecause of the problems associated with Boulder's fierce winds, it is essential that proprietary newspaper distribution machines be eliminated and that any news box or other rack or device serving any similar function in the distribution of publications be firmly affixed to the ground, and have a suitably functioning cover so that the materials are not scattered about. Permanent installation in turn requires city ownership to allocate fairly responsibilities and privileges to users of the right-of-way.\n(d)\tAccordingly, this chapter is intended to regulate the design and placement of newspaper distribution machines within the right-of-way in the downtown commercial area of the city, where lack of regulation appears at present to present the most acute harm to the public good. However, the amount of space which can be devoted to these machines is limited, and thus, of necessity, a method of allocating that space must be devised.\n(e)\tThe city council has carefully considered what the best method of allocating this scarce public property resource for private newspaper distribution machines might be, and has determined that the news box bank method, similar to that which has been used on the downtown mall, best fits the circumstances of the downtown area, supplemented as needed with an additional joint use news box with multiple spaces for publications which are free and generally physically smaller.\n(f)\tThe city council has determined that joint use news boxes should be used in addition to individual news boxes, in order to accommodate free publications that cannot afford a larger individual news box space.\n(g)\tThe city council has determined that, at present, the problems caused by unregulated news boxes are most acute at only three locations, and that it desires to begin regulation by use of publicly owned news box banks only at those three locations. Publishers and distributors who use news boxes have contended that they should be allowed to regulate themselves, and reducing the areas to be regulated by the news box bank method from all of the downtown and University Hill to three areas will allow the industry to show if it can do what heretofore it has not had any interest in doing.\n(h)\tNewspaper vending machines on the downtown Boulder Mall shall continue to be regulated in accordance with chapter 4-11, \"Mall Permits and Leases,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(i)\tThe city council has determined that requiring all news boxes everywhere on public property which are not in a public news box bank to contain identifying information, so that owners may be contacted by affected members of the public and public officials in case problems arise as a result of news box placement, is an insignificant intrusion and will, if publishers and distributors are in fact desirous of avoiding conflicts, improve public safety and welfare, and will be a necessary component of any further regulatory system short of the public news box bank system. The council has further determined that empty and apparently unused news boxes serve no useful purpose and are a nuisance, and that there should be a system by which the city may remove them from the public right-of-way.\n(j)\tIn adopting these regulations, the council intends to avoid doing anything which could be construed as censorship of the content of the publications placed in these news boxes, or of vesting standardless or unreviewable discretion in any public official which could be used to affect the content of the publications which appear in these newspaper distribution machines or otherwise interfere with rights guaranteed under the First Amendment and this chapter and any other provisions of the code ancillary to it shall be interpreted so as to avoid any such unconstitutional applications.\nOrdinance Nos. 7307 (2003); 8642 (2024)"

The city council intends to regulate the cultivation and production of hemp as it affects the community by its odor and potentially dangerous production process and not to treat hemp the same as marijuana, except to recognize it comes from the same plant with the same odor and is produced in the same or substantially similar manner as marijuana, and finds that the provisions of this chapter are directly and demonstrably related to the cultivation and production of hemp establishments in a manner to minimize negative impacts on the community.\n(1)\tHemp cultivation, and production can have an impact on health, safety, and community resources, and the code is intended to permit hemp cultivation and production where it will have a minimal impact, and potential negative impacts are minimized.\n(2)\tThe General Assembly has adopted enabling legislation and the Colorado Department of Agriculture and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment have adopted regulations that provide for hemp cultivation, however, the state law is not intended to, and does not, address the local impacts of hemp cultivation or production, making it appropriate for local regulation of hemp operations.\n(3)\tThis chapter is intended to specify the time, place, and manner restrictions for cultivation and production of hemp.\n(4)\tThe cultivation or production of hemp without a license from the city as provided in this chapter is prohibited within the city.\n(b)\tPurpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents, businesses, and property in the city by prescribing the manner in which cultivation and production of hemp can be conducted in the city.\nFurther, the purpose of this chapter is to:\n(1)\tProtect public health and safety through reasonable limitations on hemp cultivation and production operations as they relate to noise, air, and water quality, food safety, neighborhood and public safety, and other health and safety concerns;\n(2)\tImpose fees for licensing hemp businesses in an amount sufficient for the city to recover its costs of the licensing program;\n(3)\tAdopt a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this chapter;\n(4)\tCreate regulations that address the particular needs of the residents and businesses of the city and coordinate with laws that may be enacted by the State of Colorado regarding hemp;\n(5)\tIssue hemp licenses only to individuals and entities that have demonstrated an intent and ability to comply with this chapter without monitoring by city officials;\n(6)\tProtect public safety and residential areas by limiting the areas of the city where more than six hemp plants may be grown; and\n(7)\tEnsure that any production that converts hemp to marijuana is subject to Chapter 6-16 of this Code.\n(c)\tRelationship to State Law. The provisions in this chapter that are different from the applicable state law are consistent with the city's responsibility to protect the public health, safety, and welfare as authorized by applicable law, and by the home rule authority granted to the city by Article XX of the Colorado Constitution and the Charter of the city. The city intends that both state law and this chapter apply within the city. Where this chapter conflicts with the state law, this chapter shall apply.\nOrdinance No. 8393 (2020)"
