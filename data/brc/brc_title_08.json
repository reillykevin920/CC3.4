    "verbatim": "8-1-1. Legislative Intent.\n(a)\tCharter Section 106 provides that the city council may create local improvement districts to construct public improvements that confer special benefits upon land. If, however, the owners of a majority of all property benefited and subject to an assessment protest against the formation of the district, the council may create a district only if the city bears at least one-half of the costs of the improvements.\n(b)\tThe purpose of the chapter is to establish procedures by which the city council may create local improvement districts for the construction, installation, reconstruction, renewal and replacement of local improvements that confer special benefit upon land, as authorized by Charter Section 106. The purpose of local improvement districts is to enhance the city's ability to provide public improvements by assessing all or part of the cost of the improvements against the properties that specially benefit. Public improvements that may be constructed, installed, reconstructed, renewed or replaced by means of a local improvement district include, without limitation, improvements to the water, wastewater, flood control and storm drain utility systems; streets, roadways and alleys; medians, curbs, gutters and sidewalks; street lights; landscaping; bicycle ways; and parking. The construction or installation of more than one such improvement may be accomplished as one project under the provisions of this chapter.\n(c)\tProperty against which assessments for local improvements may be levied must be specially benefited by the improvements, as demonstrated by factors such as increased market value; improved access; improved safety; adaptability of land to an economically more profitable use; enhanced livability; decreased maintenance cost; and increased recreational opportunities. Although the method for computing assessments may vary according to the type of improvement, all assessments must be fair, equitable and consistent with the benefit that the assessed land receives."

Notice under this subsection is sufficient if it is mailed first class to the address of the last known owner of property on the records of the Boulder County Assessor, or if given by personal service, or, in the case of a condition sufficiently dangerous to constitute an emergency, given orally in person or by telephone to the owner or the owner's authorized representative.

If any person fails or refuses to pay when due any charge imposed under this section, the city manager may, in addition to taking other collection remedies, certify due any unpaid charges, including interest, to the Boulder County Treasurer, to be levied against the person's property for collection by the County in the same manner as delinquent general taxes upon such property are collected, under the procedures prescribed by section 2-2-12, \"City Manager May Certify Taxes, Charges and Assessments to County Treasurer for Collection,\" B.R.C. 1981.

The city council intends that all decisions regarding the granting of permission to place an encroachment into public right-of-way or public easements are legislative in nature. The city may determine from time to time at its discretion to issue a revocable permit, short-term lease or long-term lease subject to the requirements set forth in this section for certain encroachments into public rights-of-way and public easements that do not adversely affect its present or future use.\n(b)\tPermit Required and Application Requirements: No person shall place, maintain or continue to use or maintain any encroachment in the public right-of-way or in a public easement unless such person has a revocable permit, short term lease or long term lease granted under this section; a small cell facilities in the public right-of-way permit under Section 8-6-6.5, \"Small Cell Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way Permits,\" B.R.C. 1981; a revocable permit granted pursuant to City Charter Section 115; a current franchise agreement with the city; or a right to be in the public right-of-way pursuant to state law. An applicant for permission to encroach on public right-of-way or easement shall:\n(1)\tFile a written application on a form provided by the city manager that includes the following: the date, the name of the applicant, the exact location of the proposed encroachment or obstruction, a written statement describing why the encroachment is necessary, the type of encroachment or obstruction and such other information as the city manager may deem necessary;\n(2)\tFile evidence of and maintain liability insurance meeting the requirements of Section 4-1-8, \"Insurance Required,\" B.R.C. 1981;\n(3)\tPay the fee prescribed by Section 4-20-20, \"Revocable Right-of-Way Permit/Lease Application Fee,\" B.R.C. 1981; and\n(4)\tIf the encroachment is a wireless communications facility, demonstrate that the wireless communications facility has city manager approval for the proposed location pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 9-6-4(f), \"Wireless Communications Facility,\" B.R.C. 1981, and meets the standards of Paragraph 9-6-10(a)(1), B.R.C. 1981.\n(c)\tPermit or Lease Determination: The city manager will consult with the planning, public works, fire and police departments to determine whether the application should be processed as a revocable permit, a short-term lease or a long-term lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a wireless communications facility encroachment may only be processed as a revocable permit under this section. The manager shall notify the applicant whether the application will be processed as a revocable permit under Subsection (d) of this section or as a lease under Subsection (e) or (f) of this section. Unless the encroachment is a wireless communications facility meeting the provisions of Paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the following factors weigh in favor of a lease:\n(1)\tPermanency of the encroachment;\n(2)\tPhysical difficulty of removal;\n(3)\tLikely need for city intervention if removal is required within ten days;\n(4)\tMonetary value is created by the encroachment or the encroachment excludes the use of the public right-of-way by the general public; and\n(5)\tThe resultant benefit from the encroachment is commercial in nature, rather than personal.\n(d)\tRevocable Permit: The city manager may issue a revocable permit for a period not to exceed three years, upon finding that:\n(1)\tThe encroachment is designed in a manner to be temporary in nature or the encroachment is a wireless communications facility approved pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 9-6-4(f), \"Wireless Communications Facility,\" B.R.C. 1981, that meets the standards of Paragraph 9-6-4(f)(1), B.R.C. 1981;\n(2)\tThe encroachment does not constitute a traffic or other hazard;\n(3)\tThe encroachment does not destroy or impair the public's use of the land for its intended purposes or serves a public purpose that cannot otherwise be accomplished without such minor impairment; and\n(4)\tEncroachment on a sidewalk in commercial areas maintains a minimum clearance of eight feet vertically and horizontally of unobstructed pedestrian way. The requirements of this paragraph may be modified by the city manager if reasonable passage is provided on the sidewalk and the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists is not impaired.\n(e)\tShort Term Leases: The city manager may enter into a lease on public right-of-way or a public easement for encroachments that are temporary in nature or easily removed, subject to the provisions of Section 2-2-8, \"Conveyance of City Real Property Interests,\" B.R.C. 1981, upon finding that the standards for a revocable permit set forth in subsection (d) of this section have been met, and:\n(1)\tA longer termed use of the public property for the specific term approved will not be contrary to the public interest and ultimate use of the public right-of-way or public easement;\n(2)\tAdequate compensation is provided to the City throughout the lease term.\n(f)\tLong Term Leases: The city council may approve a long-term lease on public right-of-way or a public easement for encroachments that are permanent in nature subject to the provisions of Section 2-2-8, \"Conveyance of City Real Property Interests,\" B.R.C. 1981, upon a finding that the standards for a revocable permit and a short-term lease set forth in Subsections (d) and (e) of this section have been met, and there will be no public need for the leased area during the lease period.\n(g)\tTerms and Conditions of Permits and Leases: The city council or city manager may add any conditions and terms to a revocable permit, short term lease or long term lease to ensure: protection of the public health, safety and welfare; that are necessary to manage the size and placement of any encroachment or improvement in the public right-of-way; that the city's real property interests are maintained: and public improvements are fully restored upon revocation, termination or expiration of the lease or permit.\n(h)\tAttachments to Facilities: Any person with any facility in the public right-of-way shall permit the city to make use of such facility, at no cost to the city, for the placement of city equipment or facilities necessary to serve police, fire, emergency, public safety or traffic control purposes, or for any other purpose consistent with the city's police powers. City equipment or facilities include without limitation signs, fiber optic cable, lighting fixtures, solar photovoltaic systems and traffic signal equipment such as signal displays, pedestrian push buttons, traffic detection devices and communication equipment.\n(i)\tAASHTO Standards: Any person who places street-light poles in the public right-of-way shall comply with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (\"AASHTO\") requirements for roadway setbacks. If the distance between the curb line and the property line along the street is less than three feet, such person shall obtain easements or other property interest necessary for its street lighting facilities. Any modifications to the standards in this subsection shall be completed in accordance with the standards for alterations, modifications and waivers in the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards.\n(j)\tLeases for Point-to-Point Telecommunication Conduit Crossings: The city manager is authorized to enter into a lease for a telecommunication conduit crossing public right-of-way pursuant to an approved right-of-way permit under Chapter 8-5, \"Work in the Public Right-of-Way and Public Easements,\" B.R.C. 1981, which shall be leased by a single private user to provide a direct communication link between two properties.

Any small cell facility that is constructed in a historic district shall be required to get an alteration certificate pursuant to Chapter 9-11, B.R.C. 1981. The city manager is the approval authority for alteration certificates and will use the standards and criteria in Section 9-11-18, \"Standards for Landmarks Alteration Certificate Applications,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(11)\tPublic Safety. Any ground mounted equipment shall be located in a manner necessary to address both public safety and aesthetic concerns in the reasonable discretion of the city manager. The applicant shall demonstrate that the vertical infrastructure to which any equipment is fastened to can safely support such equipment.\n(12)\tSidewalk Clearance. Any encroachment on a sidewalk shall maintain a minimum clearance of eight feet vertically and horizontally of unobstructed pedestrian way. The requirements of this paragraph may be modified by the city manager if reasonable passage is provided on the sidewalk and the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists is not impaired.\n(13)\tUnreasonable Interference with Traffic and Parking Prohibited. Small cell shall not alter vehicular circulation or parking within the right-of-way or impede vehicular, bicycle or pedestrian access or visibility along the right-of-way. All equipment installations shall comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act and every other local, state and federal law and regulation. No small cell may be located or maintained in a manner that causes unreasonable interference. Unreasonable interference means any use of the right-of-way that disrupts or interferes with its use by the city, the general public or other persons authorized to use or be present upon the right-of-way, when there exists an alternative that would result in less disruption or interference. Unreasonable interference includes any use of the right-of-way that disrupts vehicular or pedestrian traffic, any interference with public utilities and any other activity that will present a hazard to public health, safety or welfare.\n(14)\tThe city manager may modify the design standards of this subsection (e) if the manager finds that the proposed design will result in an improved design with less adverse impacts than if the small cell facility met the design standards of this subsection.\n(f)\tCompliance with Other Laws.

Any small cell facility in the public right-of-way that is not used for a period of six months or more shall be deemed to be abandoned. No small cell facility owner or applicant shall fail to remove a wireless communications facility that is abandoned or is unused for a period of six months. If the small cell facility owner fails to remove an abandoned facility at the request of the city manager, the city manager may remove the small cell facility and charge the costs to the small cell facility owner.\n(h)\tExclusion of Competitors Prohibited. No small cell facility owner or lessee or officer or employee thereof shall act to exclude or to attempt to exclude any other competitor from using the same structure for the location of other antennas.\n(i)\tConditions of Approval. Any construction proposed or design elements that are approved as part of a small cell application, to insure compliance with the provisions of this section, shall be considered conditions of approval granted for the small cell facility.\n(j)\tApplication Fee. An applicant for a small cell facility shall pay the fees described in Section 4-20-43, \"Development Applications Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981, for wireless communications facilities.\n(k)\tApplication and review. Applications for wireless facilities in the public right-of-way shall be processed and reviewed using the review procedures and requirements described in Section 9-6-4(f)(5), \"Wireless Communications Facility,\" B.R.C. 1981, for the review of initial applications and for eligible facilities requests. The city manager shall be the final approval authority for all eligible facilities requests.\n(1)\tFor small cell networks involving multiple individual small cell facilities the city will allow the applicant, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the small cell network instead of filing separate applications for each individual small cell facility.\n(2)\tFor a consolidated application, each small cell facility within the consolidated application remains subject to review for compliance with the requirements of this section. The denial of any individual small cell facility is not a basis to deny the consolidated application as a whole or any other small cell facility incorporated within the consolidated application.\n(3)\tIf a wireless service provider applies to locate or collocate several wireless service facilities within the city, the city manager will:\n(A)\tAllow the applicant, at the applicant's discretion, to file a single set of documents that will apply to all the wireless service facilities to be sited; and\n(B)\tRender a decision regarding all the wireless service facilities in a single administrative proceeding.\n(l)\tSubmittal Requirements. The applicant shall submit a completed application, signal interference letter, fees, scaled site plan(s), photo simulation(s), scaled elevation view(s) and other supporting drawings, calculations and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate qualified professionals, showing the location and dimension of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, drainage, and other information deemed by the city manager to be necessary to assess compliance with this section.\n(m)\tInventory of existing sites. Each applicant for a small cell facility shall provide to the city manager a narrative and map description of the applicant's existing or then currently proposed small cell facilities within the city, and outside of the city within one mile of its boundaries. In addition, the applicant shall inform the city generally of the areas of the city in which it believes small cell facilities may need to be located within the next three years. The inventory list should identify the site name, site address or general vicinity if no address is known and a general description of the facility (i.e. - rooftop antennas and ground mounted equipment). This provision is not intended to be a requirement that the applicant submit its business plan, proprietary information or make commitments regarding locations of small cell facilities within the city. Rather, it is an attempt to provide a mechanism for the city and all applicants for small cell facilities to share general information to promote competition and collocation, assist in the city's planning process and promote collocation by identifying areas in which small cell facilities might be appropriately constructed for multiple users.\n(n)\tInformation sharing. The city may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate small cell facilities within the city for planning purposes.\n(o)\tIndemnification. As a condition of the permit, the wireless service provider shall agree, at its sole cost and expense, to indemnify, hold harmless and faithfully defend the city, its officials, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees against any claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction, maintenance or operation of its equipment authorized by this section. This will apply whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by applicable law or a permit requirement, except in cases where liability is solely caused by the gross negligence of the person or persons covered by the indemnity.\n(p)\tFederal requirements. All small cell facilities shall meet the current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate small cell facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the small cell facilities shall bring such facility into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling federal agency.\n(q)\tRadio frequency standards. All small cell facilities shall comply with federal standards for radio frequency emissions.\n(r)\tSignal interference. All small cell facilities shall be designed and sited so as not to cause interference with the normal operation of radio, television, telephone and other communication services utilized by adjacent residential and non-residential properties; nor shall any such facilities interfere with any public safety communications.\n(s)\tOperation and maintenance. To ensure the structural integrity of small cell facilities, the owner of a small cell facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building and safety codes. If upon inspection, the city concludes that a small cell facility fails to comply with such codes and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon written notice being provided to the owner of the small cell facility, the owner shall have thirty days from the date of notice to bring such small cell facility into compliance. Upon good cause shown by the owner, the city manager may extend such compliance period. If the owner fails to bring such small cell facility into compliance within said time, the city may remove such small cell facility at the owner's expense.\n(t)\tModifications. The city manager may approve a modification to the requirements of this section that would result in a violation of state or federal law or in accordance with Section 1.05, \"Alterations, Modifications, and Waivers,\" of the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards.\n(u)\tThe approval under this section for any small cell facility expires if the small cell facility is not established within one year of the approval or if it is abandoned or unused for a period of six months.\nOrdinance Nos. 8215 (2017); 8373 (2019); 8556 (2023); 8694 (2025)"

    "verbatim": "8-7-1. Legislative Intent.\n(a)\tColumbia Cemetery is located between College and Pleasant Avenues immediately west of Ninth Street, and has also at times been called the Pioneer Cemetery or the Pioneer Gateway. It was established through the purchase by the Columbia Lodge No. 14, A.F. and A.M. (the Masons), in 1870, of ten acres for cemetery purposes on what was then the edge of town. In 1870 the Boulder Lodge No. 9, I.O.O.F. (the Odd Fellows) purchased an interest in the cemetery. In 1912 the Park Cemetery Association acquired title to the cemetery from the Masons and the Odd Fellows. The City took title to the Columbia Cemetery from the Association in 1966, when the Association could no longer financially support the site. The City accepted an administrators deed (the Association being in receivership at the time) with several reservations, including a requirement that only those persons possessing a deed to a plot were to be buried there in the future, and that sale of lots would cease. In 1977 the cemetery was designated as a landmark site by ordinance 4252, and in 1997 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This chapter is intended to supplement laws applicable to conduct on public property generally by establishing rules for conduct of persons while within or otherwise affecting the Columbia Cemetery. The cemetery is operated by the City principally for its traditional private purposes as a resting place for the dead, for those who are visiting these graves, for burials and grave side services and for maintenance of the grounds. Because it was established in 1870, it is also a repository of the City's history, and its management is secondarily guided by preservation of its historic character for the public good.\n(b)\tWhile the public is generally permitted on the cemetery subject to the law and the restrictions of this chapter where not inconsistent with its private and public purposes, the cemetery is not a public park and is not a public forum. It has no chapel or other building for gatherings of people, no significant area not already occupied by graves, and no place for parking vehicles.\n(c)\tUnlike some cemeteries operated by other cities since their inception or nearly so, it is only recently as time is measured in the cemetery business that the City became the owner of this old cemetery. While burials in the cemetery are now infrequent, there are persons claiming rights in cemetery lots or grave spaces based on purchase long before the City owned the cemetery. Proof of such rights is often difficult, because some records believed to have existed have disappeared, the Masonic Lodge #14's deed book does not begin until 1887, it was not necessary by law to record purchases of cemetery lots or grave spaces, and some mortuaries did not specify exact locations of burials, sometimes simply saying \"Potter's Field\" or \"Columbia Cemetery\" for burial locations. Even where the records seem clear as to ownership of apparently unused grave spaces, there can still be uncertainty as to whether they are indeed empty. The council recognizes that some persons who may possess such rights, especially by inheritance, may have little if any proof of such rights, and it is intended that the city manager be vested with wide discretion to deal with these situations as the manager sees fit, considering such records as the city possesses, giving such weight to private records as is appropriate considering the source, and with appropriate consideration of the importance of the place of burial to the individuals involved while alive, and to their survivors balanced against the rights of other potential claimants for the space and the need for fair and businesslike operation of the cemetery.\n(d)\tWhile it is often not immediately obvious to the casual visitor, many of the grave markers in the cemetery are fragile (despite being, in many cases, made of stone, metal or other usually durable materials), and are subject to being overturned with little force. Significant restrictions on the use of the cemetery are necessary to prevent damage to these historic and venerated objects, and to guard against injury to persons from toppling grave markers."

Flat markers are distinguished from upright markers because they have little tendency to be overturned due to their geometry and low center of gravity.\nFlower receptacle means an urn or other container made of metal, stone or other durable material not subject to shattering which is part of or is attached to a grave marker.\nGrave goods means token objects temporarily placed on a grave as a token of remembrance or respect.\nGrave marker means a flat or upright marker over a grave space and includes, without limitation, headstones, tombstones, grave stones, memorials, monuments, monoliths, nameplates, rocks, urns, inscriptions or any other physical object used to identify a grave or graves.\nGrave space means a space or grave room intended to be used for the burial of the remains of one person. Grave spaces are the smallest subdivision of a lot. Grave space is synonymous with grave, grave room, grave site or plot where those terms are used in documents. The fact that in some instances the remains of more than one person have been buried in a single grave room, or that this chapter makes provision under some circumstances for burial of more than one person, does not affect this definition except in those contexts.\nLot means a platted lot within the cemetery containing five, six, twelve, sixteen, eighteen or twenty-four grave spaces as specified for the particular lot. Lots are subdivisions of a section.\nMortuary means a funeral home or funeral establishment operated in conformance with the laws of the state.\nSection means one of the fourteen main divisions of the cemetery, each of which contain varying numbers of lots, with each lot in turn containing varying numbers of individual grave spaces. The sections are labeled A through F, Avenue Reserve, Boulder Avenue Reserve, Central Avenue Reserve, Columbia Avenue Reserve, East Avenue Reserve, North Avenue Reserve, South Avenue Reserve and West Avenue Reserve.\nUpright marker means a grave marker which protrudes significantly above the ground and has space for visible inscriptions on a side or sides.\nVehicle has the meaning given in chapter 7-1, \"Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981."
