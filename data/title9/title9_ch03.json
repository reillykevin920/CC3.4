Because these regulations \"overlay\" basic zone standards, it is important to understand how these regulations affect a particular property before investigating the basic zone standards. Overlay district standards described in this chapter include:\n(1)\tFloodplains;\n(2)\tWetlands;\n(3)\tAirport Influence Zone;\n(4)\tMedium Density Overlay Zone; and\n(5)\tOpportunity Zone Overlay.\n(b)\tThere are additional regulations that must also be considered, including historic preservation designations (Chapter 9-11, \"Historic Preservation,\" B.R.C. 1981), and the various street access and network plans and sub-community, area and sub-area plans adopted as part of the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan. All overlays and their requirements applicable to a specific property should be carefully considered before evaluating the basic zone standards or proceeding with conceptual design.\nOrdinance No. 8358 (2019)",

    "verbatim": "(a)\tLegislative Intent: The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain areas of the city subject to flooding in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by:\n(1)\tRestricting or prohibiting certain uses that are hazardous to life or property in time of flood;\n(2)\tRestricting the location of structures intended for human occupancy and regulating the manner in which such structures may be built in order to minimize danger to human life within and around such structures;\n(3)\tRequiring that those structures allowed in the floodplain be expanded or enlarged, and equipment and fixtures be installed or replaced, in a manner designed to prevent their being washed away and to assure their protection from severe damage;\n(4)\tRegulating the method of construction and replacement of water supply and sanitation systems in order to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions;\n(5)\tMaintaining for public inspection available maps delineating areas subject to such provisions in order to protect individuals from purchasing or using lands for purposes that are not suitable;\n(6)\tProtecting and preserving the water-carrying and water-retention characteristics and capacities of watercourses used for conveying and retaining floodwaters; and\n(7)\tObtaining and maintaining the benefits to the community of participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.\n(b)\tFlooding May Occur: The degree of flood protection provided by the terms of this chapter has been determined to be reasonable for regulatory purposes. Floods of greater magnitude will occur, and flood heights may be increased as a result of natural or human-made causes. The provisions of this chapter do not imply that areas outside of the floodplain or land uses permitted within the floodplain are free from flooding, flood hazard, or flood damages. A grant or approval by the city under the requirements of this chapter does not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind or nature by the city or any city official or employee of the practicability or safety of any structure or proposed use, and it creates no liability to or cause of action against the city or any city official or employee for any damages from flood or otherwise that may result from such structure or use.\n(c)\tScope and Application:\n(1)\tThe requirements of this chapter supplement those imposed on the same lands by any underlying zoning provisions of this code or other ordinance of the city. If there is a conflict between such requirements, the more restrictive controls.\n(2)\tIf a lot or parcel of land lies partly within the high hazard zone, the conveyance zone, the one hundred-year floodplain, or the five hundred-year floodplain, the part of such lot or parcel lying within such area shall meet all the standards and requirements of such respective area as prescribed by this chapter. If any portion of a structure lies partly within the high hazard zone, the conveyance zone, the one hundred-year floodplain, or the five hundred-year floodplain, all the standards and requirements of such respective area(s) as prescribed by this chapter shall apply to the entire structure unless stated otherwise.\n(3)\tIf lands located outside the city limits are included within the five hundred-year floodplain, the one hundred-year floodplain, the conveyance zone, or the high hazard zone, the requirements of this chapter shall apply to such lands upon annexation.\n(d)\tAdministration: The city manager shall administer the requirements of this chapter and shall:\n(1)\tDetermine that the requirements of this chapter have been met before issuing any permit for development in the floodplain;\n(2)\tObtain and maintain for public inspection any certificates of floodproofing required by this chapter, and any information on the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures and information specifying whether such structures contain a basement, and, if the structure has been floodproofed, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed;\n(3)\tNotify Boulder County and the Colorado Water Conservation Board before permitting any change in a watercourse and submit evidence of such notice to FEMA;\n(4)\tAdopt rules interpreting and implementing the requirements of this chapter, including without limitation, application procedures for floodplain development permits; specifications for the floodproofing of structures, substantial improvements, and utilities; and specifications for the content of and application procedures for emergency management plans;\n(5)\tAssure that the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan is consistent with the floodplain management objectives of this chapter and the regulations of FEMA;\n(6)\tMake necessary interpretations of the exact location of the boundaries of the floodplain, the five hundred-year floodplain, the one hundred-year floodplain, the conveyance zone, and the high hazard zone;\n(7)\tAmend the boundaries of the high hazard zone and the conveyance zone pursuant to Subsection (f) of this section;\n(8)\tDetermine that all necessary permits have been obtained from state, federal, or local agencies the approval of which is required before issuing any permit for development in the floodplain;\n(9)\tRequire that persons changing a watercourse maintain the watercourse so that its flood-carrying capacity is not diminished;\n(10)\tRequire that new and replacement water supply systems in the floodplain be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems;\n(11)\tRequire that new and replacement sanitary sewage systems within the floodplain be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters;\n(12)\tRequire that on-site waste disposal systems be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and\n(13)\tObtain, review, and reasonably utilize any flood elevation and floodway data available from federal, state, and other sources, including data developed pursuant to Chapter 9-12, \"Subdivision,\" B.R.C. 1981, as criteria for requiring that all new development meet the requirements of this chapter.\n(e)\tAppeals: Any person contesting the city manager's interpretation of a boundary location under Paragraph (d)(6) of this section, or any person aggrieved by the granting or denial of a floodplain development permit, may appeal such determination to the planning board through the process described in Section 9-4-4, \"Appeals, Call-Ups, and Public Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981. The request shall set forth the reason and basis for the appeal and such other information as the manager may prescribe by rule.\n(f)\tMap Amendments: As watercourse or flood channel improvements or mapping corrections are made, the city manager may amend the flood regulatory area maps to recognize the changed conditions produced by such improvements or corrections, provided that no such amendments or corrections may change a FEMA \"area of special flood hazard\" or \"regulatory floodway\" unless the city is in receipt of a letter of map amendment or a letter of map revision issued by FEMA.\n(g)\tFlood Regulatory Areas:\n(1)\tThe provisions of this chapter apply to the area shown as floodplain on the most recent maps adopted by the city council, as amended from time to time by the city manager pursuant to Subsections (d), (e), and (f) of this section.

    "verbatim": "(a)\tLegislative Intent:\n(1)\tIt is the intent of the city council in enacting this section to preserve, protect, restore, and enhance the quality and diversity of wetlands and water bodies. The council finds that streams, wetlands, and water bodies are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to high groundwater, flooding, erosion, and soil limitations and that development activities may threaten these resources. The preservation of streams, wetlands, and water bodies under this section is consistent with the goal of wetland protection set forth in the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan.\n(2)\tThe city council finds that many streams, wetlands, and water bodies have been either lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, channelizing, polluting, and other acts. Piecemeal and cumulative losses destroy or diminish the functions of the remaining streams, wetlands, and water bodies.\n(3)\tThe city council finds that it is necessary for the city to ensure protection by discouraging development activities in streams, wetlands, and water bodies and those activities at adjacent sites that may adversely affect the visibility and functional values of these resources.\n(4)\tThe city council finds that it is necessary to ensure no net loss of wetlands, by encouraging avoidance of direct or indirect impacts from activities that destroy or diminish the quantity, quality, and biological diversity of the city's water resources and adjacent buffers.\n(5)\tThe city council acknowledges that much of the city was developed prior to awareness of the value of protecting streams, wetlands, and water bodies. The city council seeks to find a reasonable balance between the property owners' desire to make reasonable uses of their properties and the public's interest in preserving and protecting these important water resources. When the destruction or diminution in function of these resources cannot be avoided, the city council finds that impacts on streams, wetlands, and water bodies should be minimized and mitigation provided for unavoidable losses.\n(6)\tNothing in this section shall be construed to prevent irrigation companies from altering water levels through the diverting, storage, or delivery of water under their historic water rights or owners of such rights from exercising those historic rights.\n(7)\tNothing in this section shall be construed to prevent compliance with applicable state or federal statutes and regulations.\n(8)\tIt is not the intent of this section to prohibit all activities within the regulated area, but rather to encourage avoidance and minimization of regulated activities within the regulated area to mitigate the impact that these activities have on streams, wetlands, and water bodies.\n(b)\tScope and Application: No person shall violate any provision of this section or fail to obtain a permit for any regulated activity or to use best management practices in regulated areas as required by this section.\n(1)\tRegulated Area: This section applies to the following:\n(A)\tAreas within the city shown on the streams, wetlands, and water bodies maps adopted pursuant to this subsection, as amended;\n(B)\tAll streams, wetlands, and water bodies on city owned or managed lands inside or outside the city limits;\n(C)\tAll city activities affecting streams, wetlands, and water bodies inside or outside of the city limits;\n(D)\tInner and outer buffer areas associated with all of the above and as defined in Paragraph (l)(3) of this section.\n(2)\tExempt Wetlands: Isolated wetlands with a size of less than four hundred square feet, regardless of property boundaries, are exempt from this section unless the wetland site provides habitat for the following species:\n(A)\tPlant, animal or other wildlife species listed as threatened or endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; or\n(B)\tPlant, animal or other wildlife species listed by the State of Colorado as rare, threatened or endangered, or as a species of special concern; or\n(C)\tPlant, animal or other wildlife species listed in the Boulder County Comprehensive Plan as critical; or\n(D)\tPlant, animal or other wildlife species listed in the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan as a species of local concern.\n(3)\tRegulatory Maps: Stream, wetland and water body regulatory maps are hereby adopted and will be maintained on file in the planning department.\n(4)\tMost Stringent Restrictions Prevail: It is not intended that this section repeal, abrogate, supersede or impair any existing federal, state or local law, easement, covenant or deed restriction. However, if this section imposes greater or more stringent restrictions or requirements, the provisions of this section shall prevail. Specifically, if an applicant for a wetlands permit pursuant to this section also acquires authorization under section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the applicant shall meet any greater or more stringent restrictions or requirements set forth in this section in addition to and independent of the restrictions of such permit.\n(c)\tPermitted, Allowed and Prohibited Uses within the Regulated Area: The purpose of this subsection is to describe activities that are exempted, conditionally permitted, requiring development review or prohibited:\n(1)\tExplanation of Table Abbreviations: The abbreviations used in the cells in table 3-1 have the following meanings:\n\"E\" (Exempted Activities): Indicates that the use type is allowed as a matter of right and no stream, wetland or water body permit is required.\n\"C\" (Conditional Use Review): Indicates that the use type will be reviewed in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.\n\"S\" (Standard Permit Review): Indicates that the use type will be reviewed in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.\n\"P\" (Prohibited Activities): Indicates that the use type is prohibited in the zone.\n\"N\" (Allowed with Notice): Indicates that the use type is allowed as a matter of right subject to the application of best management practices as defined in chapter 9-16, \"Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981, and provision of notice in paragraph (5) of this subsection. Such activity shall not significantly alter the function of the stream, wetland or water body. No person shall conduct any activity that is allowed with notice in violation of the best management practices.\n(2)\tInterpretation: The city manager may decide questions of interpretation as to which category activities not specifically listed are properly assigned to, based on precedents, similar situations and relative impacts.

A mitigation plan requires the applicant to engage in the enhancement, restoration or creation of a stream, wetland or water body in order to offset, in whole or in part, the losses or impacts resulting from that applicant's actions. This mitigation plan shall not be an alternative to the standards set forth in this subsection, but shall be used only to compensate for unavoidable losses or impacts. In making a determination of whether a mitigation plan will be required, and the degree to which it is required, the following factors will be considered:\n(A)\tThe type and value of the altered stream, wetland or water body adopted functions, the functions and associated resources to be impaired or destroyed as a result of the proposed regulated activity, and the ecological equivalency of the enhanced, restored or created stream, wetland or water body. In considering whether the enhanced, restored or created wetland is the ecological equivalent to the stream, wetland or water body impaired or destroyed, the city manager will accept an evaluation of functional values comparing the impaired or destroyed stream, wetland or water body and the proposed enhanced, restored or created stream, wetland or water body using the procedures described in \"City of Boulder, Comprehensive Wetland Remapping Project,\" by Land Stewardship Consulting, October 18, 2004. In interpreting the provisions of this section, the city manager may adopt design standards pursuant to chapter 1-4, Rulemaking,\" B.R.C. 1981;\n(B)\tThe type, size and location of the altered stream, wetland or water body and gains or losses of this particular type of resource in the Boulder Valley planning area and in the area of the altered stream, wetland or water body; and\n(C)\tThe cost and probability of success of the mitigation measures.\n(2)\tMitigation Plan Requirements: A mitigation plan shall contain:\n(A)\tAn evaluation of all of the factors set forth in paragraph (1) above;\n(B)\tThe location and ownership of the proposed mitigation site;\n(C)\tAn evaluation of the suitability of the proposed mitigation site for establishing the restored or created stream, wetland or water body;\n(D)\tThe source and ownership of any water to be used for establishing or maintaining the restored or created stream, wetland or water body;\n(E)\tA description of the sizes and types of stream reaches, wetlands or water bodies to be impaired or destroyed and restored or created;\n(F)\tThe site hydrology of the restoration or creation area;\n(G)\tA maintenance program for a period of up to five years, including, without limitation, weed control, litter and debris removal, temporary irrigation, repair of water control structures, maintenance of vegetation and wildlife habitat and clearing of culverts;\n(H)\tA description of any critical elements and possible problems that may influence the success of the project;\n(I)\tA timetable for construction and monitoring;\n(J)\tA monitoring program, including monitoring schedule, technique and success criteria; and\n(K)\tA demonstration of fiscal, administrative and technical competence to successfully execute the overall project.\n(3)\tMitigation Location: Selection of a location for an enhancement, restoration or creation project shall consider the following order of geographic preferences in the context of the goals of this section:\n(A)\tOn-site;\n(B)\tAdjacent to the site;\n(C)\tWithin the sub-basin of the existing wetland;\n(D)\tWithin the Boulder Valley planning area; or\n(E)\tIn unusual cases, outside the Boulder Valley planning area.\n(4)\tMitigation Type:\n(A)\tIn a mitigation plan, replication of the same or greater stream, wetland or water body functional value is required (in-kind replacement), unless a wetland of a different type is justified based on the functions and values of the stream, wetland or water body which is proposed to be altered.\n(B)\tPermanent, direct impacts to streams, wetlands or water bodies shall be compensated through restoration or creation.\n(C)\tTemporary, direct impacts to streams, wetlands or water bodies shall be compensated through restoration or enhancement at the location of impact at a 1:1 ratio.\n(D)\tIndirect impacts as a result of activities within a buffer area shall be compensated through enhancement of the buffer area that compensates for the impacted function.\n(5)\tCompensatory Mitigation Amount:\n(A)\tThe guidelines for wetland compensation indicating the amount of impacted streams, wetlands or water bodies to be restored or created compared to the area destroyed or impaired are in table 3-2 of this subsection. Wetland and water body compensation shall be based on total surface area.\nTABLE 3-2: WETLAND COMPENSATION\n(B)\tHigher wetland compensation ratios may be applied to mitigation that is not in-kind and/or outside the sub-basin of the original wetland.\n(C)\tA combination of creation, restoration and enhancement for direct impacts that meets the above compensation requirements may be considered under the following conditions:\n(i)\tWater rights for agricultural use within the sub-basin are unavailable;\n(ii)\tCreated, restored or enhanced wetlands are all within the basin of the original wetland; and\n(iii)\tThere is a high potential for long-term success of mitigation.\n(6)\tMitigation Banking Program: Upon adoption of a wetland mitigation banking program by the city council, if the city manager, the planning board or the city council determines that the public interest is better served, a fee may be accepted in lieu of direct action on the part of the applicant to initiate a wetland restoration or wetland creation project to offset wetland destruction or impairment from the permitted activity.

Development and redevelopment in certain RM-2 and RM-3 zoning districts has been very disruptive of the existing residential character of those areas, has failed to preserve certain historic structures, has led to many inappropriate structures being erected and thus has negatively affected the value of adjoining properties. The medium density overlay zone map which designates those portions of the medium density areas to which this section applies is set forth as Appendix D, \"Medium Density Overlay Zone,\" of this title.\n(b)\tAdditional Regulations: The following additional regulations shall apply in the medium density residential overlay zone:\n(1)\tNo person shall construct a second detached dwelling on a lot as set forth in Section 9-7-12, \"Two Detached Dwellings on a Single Lot,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(2)\tNo person shall create additional multi-dwelling units except that one additional dwelling unit per lot may be created by internal conversions of existing principal structures that are not enlarged in size subsequent to September 2, 1993, and provided that such conversions do not involve exterior modifications other than for access, including, without limitation, doors, windows and stairways.\nOrdinance Nos. 7684 (2009); 8651 (2025)",

In making such determination, the city manager will consider the deficiencies of the structure or part thereof, including without limitation, damage, decay, faulty construction, potential for collapse, disrepair or the presence of health and safety concerns such as unsanitary conditions, infestation of rats or vermin, the presence of filth and contamination, or other conditions that constitute a hazard to residents or the public.\n(f)\tMaintenance: The city council intends to preserve from deliberate or inadvertent neglect attached dwelling units in Census Tract 122.03. No owner, lessee or occupant of an attached dwelling unit shall fail to comply with the ordinances of the city regulating property maintenance, including without limitation Chapter 10-2, \"Property Maintenance Code,\" B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance Nos. 8358 (2019); 8651 (2025)\nTITLE 9\nLand Use Code",
