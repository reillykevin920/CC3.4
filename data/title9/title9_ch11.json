It is also the purpose of this chapter to develop and maintain appropriate settings and environments for such buildings, sites and areas to enhance property values, stabilize neighborhoods, promote tourist trade and interest and foster knowledge of the city's living heritage.\n(b)\tThe city council does not intend by this chapter to preserve every old building in the city but instead to draw a reasonable balance between private property rights and the public interest in preserving the city's cultural, historic and architectural heritage by ensuring that demolition of buildings and structures important to that heritage will be carefully weighed with other alternatives and that alterations to such buildings and structures and new construction will respect the character of each such setting, not by imitating surrounding structures, but by being compatible with them.\n(c)\tThe city council intends that in reviewing applications for alterations to and new construction on landmarks or structures in a historic district, the landmarks board shall follow relevant city policies, including, without limitation, energy-efficient design, access for the disabled and creative approaches to renovation.\nOrdinance Nos. 7475 (2006); 7522 (2007)",

This information shall be separated from each response upon receipt by the planning department in order to allow responses to remain anonymous. The questionnaire shall ask the property owner to indicate no opinion, support or objection to the designation, and allow room for general comments on the proposed district and any draft district specific design guidelines.

Any omission or defect in the mailed questionnaire that is not brought to the board's or council's attention or that the board or council finds did not impair a property owner's ability to indicate an opinion shall not affect the validity of the designation proceedings.\n(D)\tA copy of all responses received prior to the questionnaire deadline shall be included in the landmarks board and city council record as part of any public hearing to consider the application, however, the results of the questionnaires shall not be determinative in setting a district.\n(b)\tOmission or Defect in The Public Process: Any omission or defect in the public process described in this section that is not brought to the attention of the landmarks board or city council or that the board or council find did not impair a property owner's ability to participate in the hearing, shall not affect the validity of the designation proceedings.",

The application and permit shall be in addition to any application or permit required under chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981, and shall be on a form provided by the city manager, although the manager may combine the application and permit with any other form or permit at the manager's discretion. An applicant for a permit under this section shall pay the fee prescribed by section 4-20-37, \"Historic Preservation Application Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981, prior to the initial review and the landmarks board public hearing review, if the additional review is required. In the event that an initial stay is imposed, the time requirements of this section shall be tolled until such public hearing review fee has been paid.\n(c)\tDemolition Determination: The city manager shall determine if demolition review under this section is required by examining building permit applications for buildings described in subsection (b) of this section. A proposed action that meets the definition of \"demolition\" or \"demolish\" in section 9-16-1, \"General Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981, shall be subject to the review process required by this section. For the purposes of this review, on-site relocation shall mean the relocation of the building on the current building site. Off-site relocation shall mean the relocation of the building off the current building site.\n(d)\tInitial Review: The initial review shall occur within twenty-one days after the city manager accepts a completed permit application to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the building may be eligible for designation as an individual landmark consistent with the purposes and standards in sections 9-11-1, \"Legislative Intent,\" and 9-11-2, \"City Council May Designate or Amend Landmarks and Historic Districts,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(1)\tStaff Review: The city manager may review permit applications for all accessory buildings over fifty years old, all on-site relocations of buildings over fifty years old, and all demolition and off-site relocations for primary buildings constructed during or after 1940. If the city manager determines that there would be no significant impact or potential detriment to the historic resources of the city, the permit shall be issued if all other requirements of the permit process have been met. If the city manager determines that there is probable cause to believe that the building may be eligible for designation as an individual landmark, the issuance of the permit shall be stayed for up to sixty days from the date that a completed application is accepted by the city manager, and the permit shall be referred to the landmarks board for a public hearing. The applicant shall be notified of the initial review determination within fourteen days of the decision.\n(2)\tCommittee Review: The city manager and two designated members of the landmarks board shall review all demolition and off-site relocation permit applications for buildings built prior to 1940. If the city manager and two designated members of the landmarks board unanimously determine that there would be no significant impact or potential detriment to the historic resources of the city, the city manager shall issue the permit if all other requirements of the permit process have been met. If the city manager or one of the two designated members of the landmarks board determines that there is probable cause to believe that the building may be eligible for designation as an individual landmark, the issuance of the permit shall be stayed for up to sixty days from the date that a completed application is accepted by the city manager, and the permit shall be referred to the landmarks board for a public hearing.

At least ten days before the hearing, the city manager shall also:\n(1)\tPost the property subject to the application to indicate that a permit review appeal has been requested; and\n(2)\tMail written notice to the record owners of the property subject to the application. If the address of the property owner is not a matter of public record, any failure to send notice by mail does not invalidate any proceedings on the permit application.\n(f)\tLandmarks Board Public Hearings on Permits: The landmarks board shall hold a public hearing on the permit application within seventy-five days after the city manager accepts a completed application, pursuant to the procedures prescribed by chapter 1-3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981. If the landmarks board fails to hold a public hearing within seventy-five days after the city manager accepts a completed permit application, the city manager shall issue the permit if all other requirements of the permit process have been met.

If the board finds that the building may have historical significance under the criteria set forth in subsection (f) of this section, the application shall be suspended for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty days from the date the permit application was accepted by the city manager.\n(h)\tOne Hundred Eighty Day Stay Period: During the period of a stay of the issuance of a permit for demolition or relocation, the landmarks board may take any action that it deems necessary and consistent with this chapter to preserve the structure, including, without limitation, consulting with civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens; recommending acquisition of the property by private or public bodies or agencies; exploring the possibility of moving buildings that would otherwise be demolished; and salvaging building materials. If individual landmark or district designation has not been initiated during the one hundred eighty day period, the city manager shall issue a permit if all other requirements of the permit process have been met.\n(i)\tRecord of Demolished and Moved Properties: Prior to the issuance of a permit for demolition or relocation, the city manager may require the applicant to provide information about the building, including, without limitation, the date of original construction, significant events and occupants, architectural features and a description of the building through photographs, plans and maps. The city manager shall determine where the documentation is to be deposited.\n(j)\tExpiration: An approval under this section shall expire if a deconstruction or building permit has not been applied for within one year from the date such demolition is approved.\n(k)\tA decision or failure to take action by the city manager and two members of the landmarks board pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, or by the landmarks board pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, shall be considered an approval.\nOrdinance Nos. 5627 (1994); 5801 (1996); 5929 (1997); 7048 (2000); 7080 (2000); 7120 (2001); 7183 (2002); 7213 (2002); 8658 (2025)",
