The requirements of this section apply to all land uses, including detached dwelling units, if motor vehicle access is provided to the property from the public right-of-way, as follows:\n(1)\tFor all uses, except for detached dwelling units, the standards shall be met prior to a final inspection for any building permit for new development; redevelopment exceeding twenty-five percent of the value of the existing structure; or the addition of a dwelling unit. For purposes of this paragraph (1), the applicant shall demonstrate the value of the existing structure by submitting, at the discretion of the applicant, either the actual value assessed by the Boulder County Assessor's Office or the fair market value determined by a real estate appraiser licensed in Colorado.\n(2)\tFor detached dwelling units, the standards of this section shall be met prior to a final inspection for any building permit for new development; the demolition of a principal structure; or the conversion of an attached garage or carport to a use other than use as a parking space.\n(3)\tNotwithstanding the above, development on a property that has three or fewer dwelling units must meet the driveway width standards of this section if the development has to comply with the landscape standards of Subsection 9-9-12(b), \"Landscaping and Screening Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981. Compliance with the driveway width standards shall be met prior to final inspection of a building permit.\n(b)\tAccess for Properties Subject to Annexation: Each parcel of land under a single ownership at the time of its annexation will be reviewed in terms of access as one parcel (regardless of subsequent sales of a portion) unless the property is subdivided at the time of its annexation.\n(c)\tStandards and Criteria for Site Accesses and Curb Cuts: Any access or curb cut to public rights of way shall be designed in accordance with the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards and the following standards and criteria:\n(1)\tNumber of Access Points Permitted: One access point or curb cut per property will be permitted, unless a site plan or traffic study, approved by the city manager, demonstrates that additional access points and curb cuts are required to adequately address accessibility, circulation, and driveway volumes, and only where additional accesses and curb cuts would not impair any public use of any public right-of-way, or create safety or operational problems, or be detrimental to traffic flow on adjacent public streets.\n(2)\tAccess Restrictions: On arterial and collector streets, or if necessary for the safe and efficient movement of traffic, all accesses shall be designed and constructed with physical improvements and appropriate traffic control measures to assist or restrict turning movements, including, without limitation, acceleration or deceleration lanes, access islands, street medians, and signage, as may be required of the development if the city manager finds that they are necessary to preserve the safety or the traffic-carrying capacity of the existing street. The city manager shall determine the length and degree of the required access restriction measures for the property.\n(3)\tResidential Access to Arterial and Collector Streets Restricted: No residential structures shall have direct access onto an arterial. However, if no alternative street access is possible, an access may be permitted subject to the incorporation of any design standards determined to be necessary by the city manager to preserve the safety and the traffic-carrying capacity of the arterial or collector.\n(4)\tAccess From Lowest Category Street Required: A property that has frontage on more than one street, alley or public access shall locate its access or curb cut on the lowest category street, alley or public access frontage. If more than one access point or curb cut is necessary, an additional access or curb cut will be permitted only where the proposed access or curb cut satisfies the requirements in this section.\n(5)\tProperty Right to Access: If a property cannot be served by any access point or curb cut that satisfies this section, the city manager will designate the access point or curb cut for the subject property based on optimal traffic safety.\n(6)\tMultiple Access Points for Detached Dwelling Units: The city manager will permit multiple access points on the same street for a single lot containing a detached dwelling unit upon finding that there is at least one hundred linear feet of lot frontage adjacent to the front yard on such street, the area has a limited amount of pedestrian activity because of the low density character, and multiple access points are not inconsistent with the city's plans for curbside use on the street. The total cumulative width of multiple curb cuts shall not exceed the maximum permitted width of a single curb cut. The minimum spacing between multiple curb cuts on the same property shall not be less than sixty-five feet.\n(7)\tShared Driveways for Residential Structures: A lot with a detached dwelling unit that does not have frontage on the street from which access is taken may be served by a shared driveway that meets all of the standards and criteria for shared driveways set forth in the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards.\n(8)\tResidential Driveways: Any driveway or access for a property with a residential use must lead to an off-street parking space meeting the requirements of this title and the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards.\n(9)\tDriveway Width: Driveways shall meet the following standards (see Figure 9-1 of this section):\n(A)\tMinimum driveway width: The width of a driveway leading to an off-street parking space shall not be less than nine feet. A driveway, or portion of a driveway, may be located on an adjacent property if an easement is obtained from the impacted property owner.\n(B)\tMaximum Driveway Width: For any property with three or fewer dwelling units, the driveway width within a landscaped setback, including any associated circulation or turnarounds, shall not exceed 20 feet.\nFigure 9-1: Driveway Width\n(10)\tModification: The standards of this section may be modified under the process of Section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(11)\tExceptions: The city manager may grant an exception to the requirements of this section under the provisions of Section 9-2-2, \"Administrative Review,\" B.R.C. 1981, if the following criteria are met:\n(A)\tThe topography, configuration of a lot, or other physical constraints makes taking access from the lowest category street, alley or public access frontage impractical, or the character of the existing area is such that a proposed or existing access to the street, alley or public access frontage is compatible with the access of properties in such area;\n(B)\tThe site access and curb cuts would not impair public use of the public right-of-way; create safety or operational problems or be detrimental to traffic flow on adjacent public streets; and\n(C)\tThe site access and curb cuts will minimize impacts to the existing on-street parking patterns.\n(d)\tSite Access in the Transit Village: In the area that is a part of the Transit Village that is shown on Appendix G of Title 9, \"Land Use Regulation,\" B.R.C. 1981, all properties that request a development approval that includes any additional residential units or the addition of any nonresidential floor area shall take primary vehicular access off of a street that is consistent with the approved Transit Village Connection Plan and that is not a street that is classified as minor arterial or above on the Transportation Master Plan. Secondary vehicular access on a street that is classified as minor arterial or above may be approved if it meets all of the requirements of this section.\n(e)\tAccess Permit Required: Prior to the issuance of a building permit, a proposed site access or curb cut to public right-of-way must receive any necessary permits, including:\n(1)\tCity Streets: Any site access or curb cut proposed and constructed in City rights of way, including, without limitation, streets and alleys, require a permit under Chapter 8-5, \"Work in the Public Right-of-Way and Public Easements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(2)\tState Highways: In addition to the permit required in Paragraph (d)(1) of this section, any site access or curb cut proposed, constructed, modified, or accessing a site where a change of use is being proposed on a State Highway requires a State Highway access permit as specified in the State Highway Access Code (SHAC). Applications for a State Highway access permit shall be made to the City of Boulder, which is the Issuing Authority. The City, in conjunction with the Colorado Department of Transportation, will review all applications for conformance with SHAC design and construction requirements prior to issuance of a State Highway access permit.\nOrdinance Nos. 5986 (1998); 7287 (2003); 7655 (2009); 7681 (2009); 7738 (2010); 8018 (2014); 8409 (2020); 8651 (2025); 8696 (2025); 8697 (2025)",

    "verbatim": "(a)\tPurpose: The intent of this section is to establish safe and functional motor vehicle and bicycle parking design and location standards, ensure that motor vehicle parking plays a subordinate role to site and building design, and minimize the visual and environmental impacts of excessive parking lot paving.\n(b)\tMaximum Off-Street Parking Requirements: The following maximum off-street motor vehicle parking requirements apply to residential and nonresidential uses.\n(1)\tResidential Uses: In the MU-4 and RH-7 zoning districts, the maximum number of off-street parking spaces for an attached dwelling unit or each unit of a duplex shall be one space per dwelling unit.\n(2)\tNonresidential Uses: In the RH-3, RH-6, RH-7, and MU-4 zoning districts, the maximum number of off-street parking spaces for nonresidential uses and their accessory uses shall be one space per 400 square feet of floor area per lot or parcel if residential uses comprise less than 50 percent of the floor area. If residential uses comprise more than 50 percent of the floor area, the maximum is one space per 500 square feet of floor area per lot or parcel. This maximum does not apply in a parking district.\n(c)\tGeneral Parking Standards:\n(1)\tADA Requirements: Where off-street parking spaces are provided, accessible parking spaces shall be provided, meeting the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended.\n(2)\tElectric Vehicle Charging Requirements: Where off-street parking spaces are provided, electric vehicle charging spaces shall be provided, meeting the requirements of the City of Boulder Energy Conservation Code.\n(3)\tRounding Rule: For all motor vehicle and bicycle parking space requirements resulting in a fraction, the fraction shall be:\n(A)\tRounded to the next higher whole number when the required number of spaces is five or less; or\n(B)\tRounded to the next lower whole number when the required number of spaces is more than five.\n(4)\tParking Requirements for Lots in Two or More Zoning Districts: For lots that have more than one zoning designation, the required bicycle parking for the use(s) on the lot may be provided on any portion of the lot, subject to the provisions of this title.\n(5)\tApprovals: Any minimum off-street motor vehicle parking requirement, for spaces other than accessible spaces, in any planned development, planned residential development, planned unit development, site review, use review, or other approval has no force and effect and shall not be enforced.\n(d)\tMotor Vehicle Parking Design Standards:\n(1)\tLocation of Open or Enclosed Parking: Open or enclosed parking areas are subject to the following requirements:\n(A)\tNo parking areas shall be located in any required landscaped setback abutting a street. However, in RR, RE, RL, A, or P zoning districts, if a driveway serves as access to at least one parking space that meets the design requirements of this title and that is located outside of the landscaped setback, up to two vehicles may be parked in the driveway within the landscaped setback. The requirements of this subsection may be varied to allow off-street parking to be located within the front yard setback pursuant to the standards and procedures in Section 9-2-3, B.R.C. 1981.\n(B)\tNo parking areas shall be located closer than ten feet from a side yard adjacent to a public street in the BMS and MU-2 zoning districts.\n(2)\tParking Stall Design Standards: Parking stalls shall meet the following standards, based on stall type. The minimum maneuvering area to the rear of any parking stall shall be no less than twenty-four feet except as specified in Table 9-1 below for parking at an angle other than the 90-degree category. If the proposed use anticipates long-term parking as the major parking demand, the city manager may reduce those minimum parking stall sizes.\nTABLE 9-1: STANDARD PARKING DIMENSION STANDARDS\nTABLE 9-2: SMALL CAR PARKING DIMENSION STANDARDS\nFigure 9-2: Parking Dimensions Diagram\n(A)\tStandard Stalls: All off-street standard parking spaces shall meet the minimum size requirements established in Table 9-1 and Figure 9-2 of this section.\n(B)\tSmall Car Stalls:\n(i)\tSmall Car Stalls Allowed: A proportion of the total spaces provided in each parking area may be designed and shall be signed for small car use according to Table 9-3 of this section.\nTABLE 9-3: SMALL CAR STALLS\n(ii)\tDimensional Standards: All small car stalls shall meet the minimum size requirements as indicated in Table 9-2 and Figure 9-2 of this section.\n(C)\tAccessible Parking Stalls:\n(i)\tDimensional Standards: Accessible parking spaces shall be eight feet wide and nineteen feet in length, with the standard width drive lane. Individual spaces shall have an additional five foot-wide, diagonally striped aisle abutting the passenger side of the space. If such spaces are provided in adjacent pairs, then one five-foot aisle may be shared between the two spaces. Accessible parking spaces shall conform to the construction and design standards in the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards and be located to maximize convenience of access to the facility and minimize the need to cross the flow of vehicular traffic. (See Figure 9-3 of this section.)\nFigure 9-3: Accessible Parking Space Design\nAccessible spaces must measure eight feet by nineteen feet and be flanked by a five-foot diagonally-striped aisle. Two adjacent spaces may share a single five-foot aisle. The aisle must be at the same grade as the accessible space and any adjacent sidewalk must slope to meet the grade of the aisle. The slope may not exceed 1:12.\n(ii)\tParking Waiver for Previously Conforming Accessible Parking Spaces: If a previously conforming required accessible parking space was rendered nonstandard by the amendment to Subparagraph (d)(2)(C)(i) of this section which required the five foot aisle, and its owner desires to add such an aisle, and the addition will reduce the available parking below that required for the premises, such owner may apply to the city manager for a parking waiver. The manager shall grant such a waiver insofar as it is necessary and appropriate to permit all required parking spaces for the disabled to be conforming spaces.\n(3)\tDrive Aisles:\n(A)\tThere is a definite and logical system of drive aisles to serve the entire parking area. Drive aisles shall have a minimum eighteen-foot width clearance for two-way traffic and a minimum ten-foot width clearance for one-way traffic unless the city manager finds that the parking stalls to be served require a greater or lesser width. A physical separation or barrier, such as vertical curbs, may be required in order to separate parking areas from the travel lanes. (See Figure 9-4 of this section.)\nFigure 9-4: Drive Aisles\nDrive aisles provide access to parking areas but not to individual spaces. Drive aisles serving two-way traffic must be a minimum of eighteen feet wide. Drive aisles serving one-way traffic must be a minimum of ten feet wide. Raised planters, curbs, or other physical barriers may be necessary to separate parking areas from travel lanes. See Tables 9-1and 9-2 of this section for parking aisle dimensions.\n(B)\tTurnarounds are provided for dead-end parking bays of eight stalls or more. Turnarounds must be identified with a sign or surface graphic and marked \"no parking.\" The use of accessible parking spaces as the required turnaround is not permitted. (See Figure 9-5 of this section.)\nFigure 9-5: Parking Turnaround Spaces\nIn dead-end parking bays with eight or more stalls, a turnaround space must be provided and properly marked.\n(4)\tParking Access:\n(A)\tNo parking stall is located so as to block access by emergency vehicles.\n(B)\tDriveways located in required yards are situated at an angle of approximately ninety degrees to the street to which they connect.\n(5)\tParking Design Details:\n(A)\tIf parking lot lighting is provided, all lighting shall comply with Section 9-9-16, \"Lighting, Outdoor,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(B)\tWith the exception of parking areas for detached dwelling units, all parking areas shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, or other similar permanent, hard surface. Parking areas for detached dwelling units shall be surfaced with materials capable of sustaining the weight and impacts of the associated vehicle usage.\n(C)\tSuitable curbs or barriers to protect public sidewalks and to prevent parking in areas where parking is not permitted are provided, except for parking areas for detached dwelling units.\n(D)\tAll open off-street parking areas with five or more spaces shall be screened from the street and property edges and shall provide interior lot landscaping in accordance with Section 9-9-14, \"Parking Lot Landscaping Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(E)\tDriveways parallel to public sidewalks are separated from such walks by an eight-foot landscaped area or a solid wall at least forty-two inches in height.\n(F)\tWheel or bumper guards are located so that no part of a vehicle extends beyond a parking area boundary line, intrudes on a pedestrian way, or contacts any wall, fence, or planting. A vehicular overhang may, however, intrude into a private pedestrian way located on the perimeter of a parking lot if the pedestrian way is not less than six feet in width. (See Figure 9-6 of this section.)\nFigure 9-6: Permitted Vehicular Overhang\n(G)\tWithin the DT zoning districts, at-grade parking is not permitted within thirty feet of a street right-of-way unless approved as part of a site review approval under Section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term \"street\" does not include \"alley.\"\n(e)\tBicycle Parking:\n(1)\tRequired Bicycle Spaces: Bicycle parking spaces must be provided as required by Table 9-4 of this section. Where more than 10 spaces are required, at least five percent of the required bicycle parking spaces shall be designed to accommodate and signed for larger bikes with dimensions of at least 10 feet of length and 3 feet of width.\nTABLE 9-4: OFF-STREET BICYCLE PARKING REQUIREMENTS\n(2)\tBicycle Facilities: Both bicycle lockers and racks shall:\n(A)\tProvide for storage and locking of bicycles, either in lockers, medium-security racks, or an equivalent installation in which both the bicycle frame and the wheels may be locked by the user.\n(B)\tBe designed so as not to cause damage to the bicycle.\n(C)\tFacilitate easy locking without interference from or to adjacent bicycles.\n(D)\tBe anchored with tamper-resistant anchors so that they cannot be easily removed.\n(E)\tBe of solid construction, resistant to rust, corrosion, hammers, grinders, saws, and other tools.\n(F)\tBe consistent with their environment in color and design and be incorporated whenever possible into building or street furniture design.\n(G)\tBe located in convenient, highly visible, active, well-lighted areas.\n(H)\tBe located so that they do not interfere with pedestrian movements.\n(I)\tBe identified by wayfinding signs if the bicycle parking area is not visible from the site or building entrance.\n(3)\tShort-Term Bicycle Parking: Short-term bicycle parking is intended to offer a convenient and accessible area to park bicycles for customers and other visitors. Short-term bicycle parking shall be located:\n(A)\tOn the public access level;\n(B)\tWithin fifty feet of the main building entrances;\n(C)\tOutside the building; and\n(D)\tIn an area that allows for passive surveillance, such as in front of business windows and in high-traffic areas.\n(4)\tLong-Term Bicycle Parking: Long-term bicycle parking offers a secure and weather-protected place to park bicycles for employees, residents, commuters, and other visitors who generally stay at a site for several hours. Long-term bicycle parking shall meet the following standards:\n(A)\tLong-term bicycle parking is required to be covered, access restricted, and designed to include at least one of the following security strategies:\n(i)\tA room locked by a heavy-duty locking mechanism;\n(ii)\tAn area enclosed by a fence that is resistant to forced entry and climbing, has some transparency to allow for surveillance, and incorporates a gate with a heavy-duty gate lock that is resistant to manipulation;\n(iii)\tAn area within view of an attendant or security guard or monitored by security cameras pointed at the entrances to the bicycle parking area and the bicycle racks; or\n(iv)\tAn area visible from employee work areas.\n(B)\tThe bicycle parking area must be located on site or in an area within three hundred feet of the building it serves. Access to the area shall not require the use of stairs but may require a ramp if needed for grade changes. If an elevator is required to reach the long-term bicycle parking, elevator cab dimensions must fit a bicycle.\n(C)\tAdequate lighting, designed to illuminate and allow for surveillance, shall be provided for the bicycle parking area, the route to the bicycle parking area, and the route to the building entrance if bicycle parking is provided within the building.\n(D)\tThe bicycle parking area shall include adequate clearance around racks or lockers to give cyclists room to maneuver, and to prevent conflicts with pedestrians or parked cars.\n(E)\tIf the bicycle parking is provided in a motor vehicle parking garage, the bicycle parking spaces shall be clearly marked as such and shall be separated from motor vehicle parking by physical barriers.\n(F)\tNo more than 25 percent of required long-term bicycle parking spaces may be hanging vertical racks or elevated spaces of tiered racks. Any tiered or vertical hanging rack must include a mechanically-assisted lifting mechanism to mount the bicycle on any upper tier.\n(G)\tWhere more than 100 bicycle parking spaces are required by Table 9-4, \"Minimum Off-Street Bicycle Parking Requirements,\" at least five percent of bicycle parking spaces, must have electrical outlets suitable for charging of electric bicycles. The required bicycle charging spaces must be horizontal and shall be sized 3 feet by 10 feet per space.\n(5)\tBicycle Rental Stations. Bicycle rental stations that have permission to locate on public property or private property shall post signs with the following information:\n(A)\tLocation of the station on a map of the area;\n(B)\tName of the station if applicable;\n(C)\tTraffic law information that the city manager may require, including information about areas where riding bicycles on sidewalks is permitted or prohibited; and\n(D)\tSponsor identification or logo, if applicable, that meets the requirements of Subsection 8-6-11(b), B.R.C. 1981. The sign permitting requirements in Section 9-9-21, \"Signs,\" B.R.C. 1981, do not apply to any such sponsor identification or logo.\n(6)\tParking Reductions and Modifications for Bicycle Parking. Upon submission of documentation by the applicant of how the project meets the following criterion, the approving authority may approve reductions to the minimum number of off-street bicycle parking, modifications to the ratio of long-term and short-term bike parking requirements of Table 9-4, reductions to the minimum number of larger spaces, and modifications to the maximum number of vertical or tiered racks, if it finds that the long-term and short-term bicycle parking needs of the use will be adequately accommodated.\n(7)\tParking Study: At the discretion of the city manager, a bicycle parking study may be required to demonstrate that adequate parking is provided either for parking provided per Boulder Revised Code requirements or in conjunction with a bicycle parking reduction request.

    "verbatim": "(a)\tPurpose: The purposes of the outdoor lighting standards are to:\n(1)\tProvide adequate light for safety and security;\n(2)\tPromote efficient and cost effective lighting and to conserve energy;\n(3)\tReduce light pollution, light trespass, glare and offensive light sources;\n(4)\tProvide an environmentally sensitive nighttime environment that includes the ability to view the stars against a dark sky so that people can see the Milky Way Galaxy from residential and other appropriate viewing areas;\n(5)\tPrevent inappropriate, poorly designed or installed outdoor lighting; and\n(6)\tEncourage quality lighting design; light fixture shielding, establish maximum uniformity ratios and establish maximum light levels within and on property lines.\n(b)\tLegislative History: The city council adopted the outdoor lighting standards of this section in 2003 with an amortization provision requiring that the outdoor lighting of all properties in the city be brought into compliance with the standards of this section no later than 2018. As of November 16, 2018, all existing outdoor lighting in the city must be in compliance with the design standards, maximum light standards, and prohibitions of this section, unless this section expressly provides for a different compliance time line.\n(c)\tScope: This section shall apply to all exterior lighting, including illumination from outdoor signs that impact the outdoor environment. No person shall install or maintain any light fixture unless such fixture meets the requirements of this section. If an existing light fixture is removed, it shall only be replaced with a conforming light fixture. Chapter 9-16-1, \"General Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981, contains specific definitions applicable to the implementation of this section, including but not limited to, \"Control\", \"Full cut-off light fixture\", \"Fully shielded light fixture\", \"Glare\", \"Illuminance\", \"Light bulb\", \"Light fixture\", Luminaire\", \"Light pollution\", \"Light trespass\", \"Lumen\", \"Luminaire\", \"Maximum allowable light level\", \"Maximum allowable light level\", \"Maximum lumen rating\", \"String of lights\", \"Uniformity ratio\", and \"White light source\".\n(d)\tDesign Standards: No person shall install or maintain any exterior lighting that fails to meet the requirements of this section:\n(1)\tMaximum Light Levels at Property Line: The maximum light level at any point on a property line shall not exceed 0.1 footcandles within or adjacent to a residential zone or 0.2 footcandles in nonresidential zones except as follows:\n(A)\tThe light emitted by light fixtures mounted on a structure built within five feet of a public street right-of-way or sidewalk shall not exceed the maximum allowable light levels for \"pedestrian areas\" specified in subsection (e) of this section for the underlying zoning district or use. The maximum allowable light level shall include any existing or proposed street or pedestrian lighting located within the right-of-way. In no case shall the maximum allowable light level within the right-of-way, excluding street lights, exceed 0.2 footcandles when measured at the curbline.\n(B)\tIn nonresidential zoning districts, unless a variance has been granted, light levels exceeding 0.2 footcandles at the property line may be approved by the city manager upon finding that the increased light levels will not adversely affect an adjacent property owner. Evidence that the light will not adversely affect an adjacent property owner may include, without limitation, a statement from such property owner that it will not be adversely affected by the increased light levels. The maximum allowable light levels specified in subsection (e) of this section shall not be exceeded when measured on the property line.\n(2)\tWhite Light Source Required: White light sources that include, without limitation, metal halide, fluorescent, or induction lamps, but excluding incandescent and halogen lamps, shall be required for any light fixture which exceeds two thousand four hundred lumens that is within a parking lot, vehicular circulation, or pedestrian use area.\n(3)\tUse of High Pressure Sodium Lamps: Full cutoff high pressure sodium lamps, not exceeding a maximum lumen rating of sixteen thousand lumens, may be used in outdoor storage areas and other similar use areas not accessible to the general public and the need for good color rendering capabilities for safety and security is not necessary.\n(4)\tArchitectural Lighting of Building Facades: The lighting of a building facade for architectural, aesthetic, or decorative purposes is permitted subject to the following restrictions:\n(A)\tUpward aimed building facade lighting shall not exceed nine hundred lumens. All upward aimed light shall be fully shielded, fully confined from projecting into the sky by eaves, roofs, or overhangs, and mounted as flush to a wall as possible.\n(B)\tBuilding facade lighting exceeding nine hundred lumens shall be fully shielded, aimed downward, and mounted as flush to a wall as possible.\n(C)\tBuilding facade lighting shall be fully contained within the vertical surface of the wall being illuminated.\n(D)\tBuilding facade lighting that is measurable at the ground level shall be included in the maximum allowable light levels.\n(5)\tUnshielded Lighting:\n(A)\tUnshielded lighting that emits more than nine hundred lumens but less than or equal to one thousand two hundred lumens is permitted provided that it is activated by a motion sensor and provided it is aimed and located in such a manner as to prevent glare and light trespass. The light shall only go on when activated and go off within five minutes of activation. Motion sensor activated lighting shall not be triggered by any movement or activity located off the property on which the light is located.\n(B)\tAll lamps and bulbs less than nine hundred lumens located in residential zones shall be within a fully shielded fixture, or must be within a light fixture where the bulb or lamp are obscured from view by a material that diffuses the light. (i.e., frosted or milk colored materials), except as otherwise permitted in this section.

    "verbatim": "(a)\tPurpose: Solar heating and cooling of buildings, solar heated hot water and solar generated electricity can provide a significant contribution to the City's energy supply. It is the purpose of this section to regulate structures and vegetation on property, including City-owned and controlled property, to the extent necessary to ensure access to solar energy, by reasonably regulating the interests of neighboring property holders within the City.\n(b)\tApplicability of Section:\n(1)\tPrivate Property: All private property is subject to this section.\n(2)\tDevelopment Approval: No proposed development permit may be approved for any structure that would violate the basic solar access provided by this section unless the object or structure is exempt or an exception is granted by the city manager or the BOZA for such purpose.\n(3)\tGovernment Property: Governmental organizations not under the jurisdiction of the City may elect to enjoy the benefits of solar access under this section if they also consent in a written agreement with the City to be bound by its restrictions.\n(4)\tCity Property: Property owned or possessed by the City is subject to, and enjoys the benefits of this section. The City may submit applications, make objections and take actions that are afforded to any other person subject to the provisions of this section.\n(c)\tSolar Access Areas Established: Three solar access areas are hereby established: SA Area I, SA Area II and SA Area III. The purpose of dividing the City into solar access areas is to provide maximum solar access protection for each area of the City consistent with planned densities, topography and lot configurations and orientations.\n(1)\tSolar Access Area I (RR-1, RR-2, RE, RL-1 and MH): SA Area I is designed to protect solar access principally for south yards, south walls and rooftops in areas where, because of planned density, topography or lot configurations or orientations, the preponderance of lots therein currently enjoy such access and where solar access of this nature would not unduly restrict permissible development. SA Area I includes all property in RR-1, RR-2, RE, RL-1 and MH zoning districts.\n(2)\tSolar Access Area II (RL-2, RM, MU-1, MU-3, RMX, RH-1, RH-2, RH-3, RH-4, RH-5 and I): SA Area II is designed to protect solar access principally for rooftops in areas where, because of planned density, topography or lot configuration or orientation, the preponderance of lots therein currently enjoy such access and where solar access of this nature would not unduly restrict permissible development. SA Area II includes all property in RL-2, RM, MU-1, MU-3, RMX, RH-1, RH-2, RH-3, RH-4, RH-5 and I zoning districts.\n(3)\tSolar Access Area III - Permits - Other Zoning Districts: SA Area III includes areas where, because of planned densities, topography or lot configurations or orientations, uniform solar access protection for south yards and walls or for rooftops may unduly restrict permissible development. Solar access protection in SA Area III is provided through permits. SA Area III initially includes property in all zoning districts other than those set forth in Paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.\n(d)\tBasic Solar Access Protection:\n(1)\tSolar Fence: A solar fence is hereby hypothesized for each lot located in SA Area I and SA Area II. Each solar fence completely encloses the lot in question, and its foundation is contiguous with the lot lines. Such fence is vertical, is opaque and lacks any thickness.\n(A)\tSA Area I: No person shall erect an object or structure on any other lot that would shade a protected lot in SA Area I to a greater degree than the lot would be shaded by a solar fence twelve feet in height, between two hours before and two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day.\n(B)\tSA Area II: No person shall erect an object or structure on any other lot that would shade a protected lot in SA Area II to a greater degree than the lot would be shaded by a solar fence twenty-five feet in height, between two hours before and two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day.\n(C)\tSA Area III: Solar fences are not hypothesized for lots located in SA Area III. Solar access protection in SA Area III is available under this section only through permits, as hereinafter provided.\n(D)\tAdjoining Duplex or Townhouse Lots in All Solar Areas: On duplex or townhouse lots, solar fences are not hypothesized on interior lot lines between adjoining units of a duplex or adjoining townhouses. Other lot lines are subject to the solar fence restrictions of subsection (A), (B), or (C), as applicable.\n(2)\tHeight: Unless prohibited by another section of this title, nothing in this section prevents a structure in SA Area III from being erected up to a height of thirty-five feet if located within the allowed building envelope. However, unless an exception is granted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, no such structure may exceed thirty-five feet in height if any such excess height would cause the structure to violate, or to increase the degree of violation of, the basic solar access protection provided for any lot in SA Area I or SA Area II.\n(A)\tNothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the principal building on a lot in SA Area I or II from being erected within the building envelope up to the height of the solar fence in the area in which the structure is located.\n(B)\tEach application for a development permit for a building of a height greater than allowed by this subsection shall:\n(i)\tInclude a graphic representation showing the shadows that would be cast by the proposed structure between two hours before and two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day;\n(ii)\tThe solar fences on all lots that the shadows would touch;\n(iii)\tAll possible obstructions of solar access protected by permit; and\n(iv)\tProvide additional information as may be required by the city manager.\n(3)\tInsubstantial Breaches and Existing Structures: Insubstantial breaches of the basic solar access protection or of the protection provided by a solar access permit are exempt from the application of this section. A structure in existence on the date of establishment of an applicable solar access area, or structures and vegetation in existence on the date of issuance of an applicable solar access permit, are exempt from the application of this section. For purposes of this section, structures are deemed to be in existence on the date of issuance of a development permit authorizing its construction.\n(4)\tTemporary Solar Obstructions: Unavoidable temporary obstructions of protected solar access necessitated by construction activities or other necessary and lawful purposes are exempt to the extent that they do not exceed ten days in any three month period and thirty days in any year.\n(5)\tSolar Analysis: When a solar analysis is required for any review process, it shall be prepared in compliance with the methods described in materials provided by the city manager.\n(e)\tAmendment of Solar Access Areas:\n(1)\tPurpose: The planning board may amend solar access areas on its own motion or on petition of any person with a property interest in the subject area. A petitioner shall submit a list to the planning board of the names and addresses of all owners of property within and adjacent to the subject area and within one hundred feet to the north and sixty feet to the east and west of the subject area.\n(2)\tPublic Hearing and Notice Required: Before amending a solar access area, the planning board shall conduct a public hearing on the proposal. The board shall provide notice for the hearing pursuant to the requirements of Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tReview Criteria: A solar access area may be amended only after the planning board determines that one or more of the following conditions applies to the subject area:\n(A)\tThe subject area was established as a particular solar access area in error, and as currently established it is inconsistent with the purposes of the solar access areas;\n(B)\tPermissible land uses and densities in the subject area are changing or should change to such a degree that it is in the public interest to amend the solar access area for the area; or\n(C)\tExperience with application of this ordinance has demonstrated that:\n(i)\tThe level of solar access protection available in the subject area can be increased without significant interference with surrounding property; or\n(ii)\tApplication of the ordinance has unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment of real property in the subject area.\n(4)\tImpact of Changes: When any area is amended from SA Area I to another solar access area or from SA Area II to SA Area III, any solar access beneficiary whose solar access is affected by such change may apply for a permit to provide solar access protection to any solar energy system installed and in use on the date the change becomes effective.\n(f)\tExceptions:\n(1)\tPurpose: Any person desiring to erect an object or structure or increase or add to any object or structure, in such a manner as to interfere with the basic solar access protection, may apply for an exception.\n(2)\tApplication Requirements: An applicant for an exception shall pay the application fee prescribed by Subsection 4-20-33(b), B.R.C. 1981, and apply on a form furnished by the city manager that includes, without limitation:\n(A)\tThe applicant's name and address, the owner's name and address, and a legal description of the lot for which an exception is sought;\n(B)\tSurvey plats or other accurate drawings showing lot lines, structures, solar systems, dimensions and topography as necessary to establish the reduction of basic solar access protection expected on each lot that would be affected by the exception, together with a graphic representation of the shadows that would be cast by the proposed structure during the period from two hours before to two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day. The requirements of this subparagraph may be modified by the city manager, depending upon the nature of the exception sought;\n(C)\tA list of all lots that may be affected by the exception, including the names and addresses of all owners of such lots;\n(D)\tA statement and supporting information describing the reasons that less intrusive alternatives, if any, to the action that would be allowed by the exception cannot or should not be implemented; and\n(E)\tA statement certifying that the proposed structure would not obstruct solar access protected by permit.\n(3)\tPublic Notice: The city manager shall provide public notice pursuant to Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(4)\tCity Manager Action: The city manager may grant an exception of this section following the public notification period if:\n(A)\tThe applicant presents the manager with an affidavit of each owner of each affected lot declaring that such owner is familiar with the application and the effect the exception would have on the owner's lot, and that the owner has no objection to the granting of the exception, and\n(B)\tThe manager determines that the application complies with the requirements in Paragraph (f)(2) of this section, and\n(C)\tThe manager finds that each of the requirements of Paragraph (f)(6) of this section has been met.\n(5)\tReferral or Appeal of City Manager's Decision: The city manager may refer the application or the city manager's decision may be appealed by the applicant to the BOZA pursuant to the procedures of Section 9-4-4, \"Appeals, Call-Ups and Public Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981. If an affidavit from each owner of each affected lot per subparagraph (f)(4)(A) cannot be obtained, the applicant may apply for consideration of the exception before the BOZA. Public notification of the hearing shall be provided pursuant to Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981. The sign posted shall remain posted until the conclusion of the hearing.\n(6)\tReview Criteria: In order to grant an exception, the approving authority must find that each of the following requirements has been met:\n(A)\tBecause of basic solar access protection requirements and the land use regulations:\n(i)\tReasonable use cannot otherwise be made of the lot for which the exception is requested; or\n(ii)\tThe part of the adjoining lot or lots that the proposed structure would shade is inherently unsuitable as a site for a solar energy system; or\n(iii)\tAny shading would not significantly reduce the solar potential of the protected lot; and\n(iv)\tSuch situations have not been created by the applicant;\n(B)\tExcept for actions under Subparagraphs (f)(6)(D), (f)(6)(E), and (f)(6)(F) of this section, the exception would be the minimal action that would afford relief in an economically feasible manner;\n(C)\tThe exception would cause the least interference possible with basic solar access protection for other lots;\n(D)\tIf the proposed structure is located in a historic district designated by the city council according to Section 9-11-2, \"City Council May Designate or Amend Landmarks and Historic Districts,\" B.R.C. 1981, and if it conformed with the requirements of this section, its roof design would be incompatible with the character of the development in the historic district;\n(E)\tIf part of a proposed roof which is to be reconstructed or added to would be incompatible with the design of the remaining parts of the existing roof so as to detract materially from the character of the structure, provided that the roof otherwise conformed with the requirements of this section;\n(F)\tIf the proposed interference with basic solar access protection would be due to a solar energy system to be installed, such system could not be feasibly located elsewhere on the applicant's lot;\n(G)\tIf an existing solar system would be shaded as a result of the exception, the beneficiary of that system would nevertheless still be able to make reasonable use of it for its intended purpose;\n(H)\tThe exception would not cause more than an insubstantial breach of solar access protected by permit as defined in Paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and\n(I)\tAll other requirements for the issuance of an exception have been met. The applicant bears the burden of proof with respect to all issues of fact.\n(7)\tConditions of Approval: The approving authority may grant exceptions subject to such terms and conditions as the authority finds just and equitable to assist persons whose protected solar access is diminished by the exception. Such terms and conditions may include a requirement that the applicant for an exception take actions to remove obstructions or otherwise increase solar access for any person whose protected solar access is adversely affected by granting the exception.\n(8)\tPlanning Board: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection, if the applicant has a development application submitted for review that is to be heard by the planning board and that would require an exception, the planning board shall act in place of the BOZA, with authority to grant exceptions concurrent with other actions on the application, pursuant to the procedures and criteria of this section.\n(g)\tSolar Siting:\n(1)\tSiting Requirements: For purposes of insuring the potential for utilization of solar energy in the city, all planned unit developments and subdivisions shall be designed and constructed in compliance with the following solar siting requirements:\n(A)\tAll residential units in Solar Access Areas I, II, and III have a roof surface that meets all of the following criteria:\n(i)\tIs oriented within thirty degrees of a true east-west direction;\n(ii)\tIs flat or not sloped towards true north;\n(iii)\tIs physically and structurally capable of supporting at least seventy-five square feet of un-shaded solar collectors for each individual dwelling unit in the building; and\n(iv)\tHas unimpeded solar access under either the provisions of this section or through easements, covenants, or other private agreements among affected landowners that the city manager finds are adequate to protect continued solar access for such roof surface;\n(B)\tEach residential unit in Solar Access Area I has an exterior wall surface that meets all of the following criteria:\n(i)\tIs oriented within thirty degrees of a true east-west direction;\n(ii)\tIs located on the southernmost side of the unit; and\n(iii)\tIs immediately adjacent to a heated space;\n(C)\tEach nonresidential building with an anticipated hot water demand of one thousand or more gallons a day has a roof surface that meets all of the following criteria:\n(i)\tIs flat or oriented within thirty degrees of a true east-west direction;\n(ii)\tIs physically and structurally capable of supporting a solar collector or collectors capable of providing at least one-half of the anticipated hot water needs of the building; and\n(iii)\tHas unimpeded solar access under either the provisions of this section or through easements, covenants, or other private agreements among affected landowners that the city manager finds are adequate to protect continued solar access for such roof surface;\n(2)\tWaivers: Upon request of any applicant for a building permit or a subdivision or planned unit development approval, the approving authority may waive such of the requirements of this paragraph as it deems appropriate if it finds that any of the following criteria are met:\n(A)\tAny structure or structures subject to the requirements of this paragraph are designed and intended to be unheated;\n(B)\tTopographic features, land slope, shading by objects, structures, or vegetation outside the control of the applicant, or the nature of surrounding development or circulation patterns when combined with the requirements of this paragraph:\n(i)\tMakes use of solar energy not feasible in some or all of the structures to be erected;\n(ii)\tWill result in a substantial decrease in the density of land use in the subdivision or planned unit development;\n(iii)\tWill result in an increase in transportation or other energy use that substantially outweighs the potential for increased solar energy use created by adherence to these requirements; or\n(iv)\tWill be inconsistent with the floodplain management requirements of Section 9-3-2, \"Floodplains,\" B.R.C. 1981;\n(C)\tSubstantial planning, design, or other preliminary expenditures have been incurred by the applicant prior to July 1, 1982, and adherence to the standards of this paragraph would work an undue hardship on the applicant;\n(h)\tSolar Access Permits:\n(1)\tPurpose of Solar Access Permit: In order to promote opportunities for the use of solar energy and where basic solar access protection established by this section is inadequate to protect potential solar energy users, or to insure maximum utilization of solar energy resources consistent with reasonable use of surrounding property, persons may obtain permits under this section. Beneficial use is the limit and measure of any right conferred by permit and no permit shall restrict use of other property beyond the extent reasonable to insure efficient and economical beneficial use of solar energy by the permittee. Further, no permit shall restrict the reasonable use and enjoyment of adjacent properties.\n(2)\tEligibility Standards: Any owner or possessor of property who has installed a solar energy system or who intends to install such a system within a year from the date of application may apply for a permit if:\n(A)\tThe lot for which a permit is requested is included in SA Area III;\n(B)\tThe system that has been or will be installed is capable of applying to beneficial use substantial amounts of solar energy outside the hours of the day during which basic protection is provided for under this section;\n(C)\tA solar energy system is in existence on the lot or is planned to be built within a year and the lot is changed from SA Area I to another solar access area or is changed from SA Area II to SA AREA III, resulting in a diminution or elimination of protection previously afforded the user or potential user of the solar energy system;\n(D)\tA new structure is built on a lot in SA Area I or SA Area II after the effective date of this section whose location renders the basic solar access protection inadequate, and the structure could not reasonably have been constructed at a location where it would have substantially benefited from the basic solar access protection provided by this section; or\n(E)\tThe applicant demonstrates that there are substantial technical, legal, or economic factors that render it infeasible to collect a reasonable amount of solar energy by utilizing the basic solar access protection available under this section without a permit. Such factors include, without limitation, structural characteristics of the applicant's building that limit possibilities for economical retrofit of a solar energy system or shading by objects, structures, or vegetation that are beyond the applicant's control and are exempt from the requirements of this section.\n(3)\tApplication Requirements: An applicant for a permit shall pay the fee prescribed by Subsection 4-20-33(a), B.R.C. 1981, and complete an application in writing on a form furnished by the city manager that includes, without limitation:\n(A)\tThe applicant's name and address, the owner's name and address, and a legal description of the lot where the solar energy system is located or will be located;\n(B)\tA statement by the applicant that the solar energy system is already installed or that the applicant intends to install such a system on the lot within one year of the issuance of the permit;\n(C)\tA description of the existing or proposed size and location of the system, its orientation with respect to south, and its elevation and orientation from the horizontal;\n(D)\tA statement describing the beneficial use to which solar energy is or will be applied and certifying the energy capacity of the system in BTUs or BTU equivalents and its reasonable life expectancy;\n(E)\tA statement and accurate drawings describing the access protection desired beyond the basic solar access protection provided by this section, specifying the hours of the day, seasons of the year, and locations on the applicant's lot for which protection is desired;\n(F)\tA description of all existing vegetation, objects, and structures wherever located that will or may in the future shade the solar energy system, together with a map or drawing showing their location to the extent possible;\n(G)\tInformation showing that the applicant has done everything reasonable in designing and locating the system so as to minimize the impact it will have on use and development on nearby land;\n(H)\tSurvey plats or other accurate drawings showing lot lines, dimensions, and topography of the lot on which the solar energy system is or will be located and all surrounding properties that are intended to be subject to the permit; and\n(I)\tA list of all lots that may be affected by the permit, including the names and addresses of all owners of such lots.\n(4)\tPublic Notice: The city manager shall provide public notification pursuant to the requirements of Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(5)\tPermit Issuance: The city manager shall issue a solar access permit and may impose additional conditions or restrictions as the manager deems appropriate if the application complies with the requirements of Paragraph (h)(7) of this section.\n(6)\tAppeal of City Manager's Decision: The city manager's decision may be appealed to the BOZA pursuant to the procedures of Section 9-4-4, \"Appeals, Call-Ups and Public Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981. Public notification of the hearing shall be provided pursuant to Section 9-4-3, \"Public Notice Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(7)\tPermit Requirements: In order to issue a permit, the approving authority must find that each of the following requirements has been met:\n(A)\tThe applicant meets at least one of the eligibility standards of Paragraph (h)(2) of this section;\n(B)\tThe applicant has done everything reasonable in designing and locating the proposed solar energy system to minimize the impact it will have on use and development of nearby land. However, the fact that an alternate design or site may be more expensive does not necessarily establish that the applicant's failure to select that alternate design or site is reasonable. In making this finding, the board or the city manager may consider whether the additional cost of alternative, less intrusive sites or solar energy systems, if any, would exceed the difference between the adverse effects, if any, imposed on other lots by the proposed site and solar energy system and the adverse effects, if any, that would be imposed on other lots by alternative sites or solar energy systems;\n(C)\tIssuance of the permit is consistent with reasonable use and enjoyment of nearby land, excluding landscaping considerations. Issuance of the permit will be presumed not to be consistent with reasonable use and enjoyment of nearby land if issuance would prevent any affected property owner from erecting, consistent with legal requirements, a structure of a size, character and usefulness reasonably typical of those in existence on similar lots subject to the same zoning requirements located within one-fifth mile of the lot in question. However, nothing in this subsection prohibits issuance of a permit only because it would impose requirements on a neighboring lot owner that are more restrictive than the height or setback requirements that would otherwise apply, if reasonable use and enjoyment of such lot is preserved; and\n(D)\tIssuance of the permit is consistent with reasonable landscaping of nearby land. In determining consistency, the board shall consider the need for any additional landscaping in the future, including any energy conservation value that such landscaping may have.\n(8)\tConditions of Approval: The board may grant permits subject to such terms and conditions as it finds just and equitable.\n(9)\tRecords: The city manager shall maintain complete records of all permits that have been issued and shall make them readily available for public inspection.\n(10)\tExpiration of Permit: A solar access permit expires if:\n(A)\tA functioning system is not installed within a year after the issuance of the permit;\n(B)\tThe solar energy system protected by the permit has not functioned to fulfill its intended purpose for a continuous period of two or more years; or\n(C)\tThe term established under Paragraph (h)(11) of this section expires.\n(11)\tTerm of Solar Energy System: The city manager or the BOZA shall specify the term of each solar access permit, which shall be for the reasonable life expectancy of the particular solar energy system, as determined by the manager or the board. At the expiration of a permit, it may be renewed in the same manner as new permits are issued.\n(12)\tRenewal of Permit: If no functioning solar energy system is installed within a year of the issuance of the permit, the city manager may grant a renewal of up to one additional year to the holder of the expired permit if the permittee demonstrates that the permittee has exercised due diligence in attempting to install the system.\n(13)\tEnforcement: A solar access permit is enforceable by the beneficiary if, and only if, the beneficiary has properly recorded the permit in the real property records of the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder with respect to each affected lot in such a manner that it could be detected through a customary title search.\n(A)\tOn sale, lease or transfer of the lot on which the protected solar system is located, the right to enforce its terms passes to the beneficial user of the system.\n(B)\tNo property owner shall be requested to remedy vegetative shading unless a protected solar system is installed and functioning.\n(14)\tImpacts of Vegetation on an Issued Permit: Upon application of a beneficiary to the BOZA, vegetative shading may be remedied to the extent necessary to comply with the terms specified in a solar access permit. However, no vegetation in the ground and growing at the time the permit application is filed may be ordered removed or trimmed. After notice to at least the beneficiary and the vegetation owner, the board shall hold a hearing and, based on evidence submitted by any interested party, may issue any necessary order and specify the time in which actions thereunder must be performed. Absent unusual circumstances, the cost of remedying shading from vegetation not in the ground and growing at the time the permit application is filed shall be borne by the vegetation owner. If an owner or possessor of real property who receives an order to remedy vegetative shading fails to comply within the specified time, the city manager may order the condition remedied and charge the actual cost thereof to the person to whom the order is directed, who shall pay the bill. If any person fails or refuses to pay when due any charge imposed under this subsection, the manager may, in addition to taking other collection remedies, certify due and unpaid charges to the Boulder County Treasurer for collection as provided in Section 2-2-12, \"City Manager May Certify Taxes, Charges and Assessments to County Treasurer for Collection,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(i)\tAuthority to Issue Regulations: The city manager and the BOZA are each authorized to adopt rules and regulations necessary in order to interpret or implement the provisions of this section that each administers.\nOrdinance Nos. 7484 (2006); 7522 (2007); 7535 (2007); 7568 (2007); 7655 (2009); 7878 (2012); 8409 (2020); 8622 (2024)",

    "heading": "Signs.",
    "verbatim": "(a)\tApplication and Legislative Intent:\n(1)\tApplication of Section: This section applies only to signs erected on private property by the owner or lessee in possession of that property, or by persons acting with the permission or at the request of the owner or lessee. It applies only to signs which are visible beyond the boundaries of the property upon which they are located. There are two exceptions to this rule which are most conveniently included in this section: signs erected on private property as part of a sign program which was a condition of approval of development under this title; and signs on private vehicles located on public property. This section does not apply to a sign carried by a person, whether on public or private property. This section does not apply to signs, other than those on vehicles, on public property.\n(2)\tIntent: The purpose of this section is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city by regulating the design, construction, and installation of private signs in the city. The city council recognizes that signs are necessary means of visual communication for the public convenience and that businesses and individuals have the right to identify themselves and convey messages by using signs that are accessory and incidental to the use on the premises where the signs are located. In this section the council intends to provide a reasonable balance between the right of a business or an individual to identify itself and to convey its message and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord that results from the unrestricted proliferation of signs, especially off-premises billboards. The ability to convey messages by signs is important to the proper and efficient functioning of society. However, the natural desire to speak more \"loudly\" through signs which are more numerous, larger, higher, and closer to the street than the signs used by one's neighbors and competitors requires a set of rules applicable to all similarly situated. With a level playing field the community as a whole benefits and no individual is disadvantaged in communicating. The council also intends by this section to ensure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community and that the value of nearby property and the economic health of the community as a whole are protected from visual blight. Another purpose of this section is to protect the public from hazardous conditions by prohibiting signs that: are structurally unsafe, particularly in light of the unique wind hazards in the city, obscure or distract the vision of motorists, or compete or conflict with necessary traffic signs and warning signals. In adopting this section, the council recognizes that the size of signs that provide adequate identification in pedestrian-oriented areas differs from that necessary in vehicular-oriented areas where traffic is heavy, travel speeds are greater, and required setbacks are greater.\n(A)\tThe city council recognizes that since the sign code was originally enacted in 1971, most nonconforming signs have been eliminated through attrition and through the amortization provision of chapter 48 of the Revised Code of the City of Boulder, Colorado 1965. But nonconforming signs may enter the city as it annexes developed land, and code changes may make conforming signs nonconforming. The council recognizes that permitting the continuation of such nonconforming signs provides an unfair competitive advantage over persons whose signs conform to the section requirements and intends that signs that do not conform with this section be eliminated as expeditiously as practicable to protect the public safety and welfare and the visual environment.\n(B)\tThe city council recognizes the right of residents of the city to fully exercise their right to free speech by the use of signs containing noncommercial messages that are subject to minimum regulations regarding size, number, structural safety and visual setbacks.\n(C)\tThe city council finds that certain types of signs are not appropriate for regulation by permit under this section because they:\n(i)\tWould not create a structural safety or traffic safety hazard;\n(ii)\tWould promote public safety or the dissemination of public information;\n(iii)\tWould not give rise to aesthetic or traffic concerns;\n(iv)\tIn the case of art, are deemed a privilege of individual creative expression;\n(v)\tIn the case of other noncommercial signs, are accessory to the exercise of first amendment rights;\n(vi)\tWith respect to permitted private traffic signs, the council finds that such signs serve a compelling governmental interest in the safe movement of traffic in private parking lots and drives and serve a function which cannot effectively be served in any other manner;\n(vii)\tWith respect to signs required by law, the council finds that the law requiring the sign is sufficient regulation of the sign, and that it is inappropriate for the government to require a sign to be posted but count it against allowable private signage, and that such signs by definition serve a compelling governmental interest in a site-specific manner which cannot otherwise be served as effectively;\n(viii)\tWith respect to permitted utility warning signs, the council finds that the dispersed nature of utility lines throughout all the community does not lend itself to the property by property regulation otherwise used in this code, and that warning of the location of utilities and of their hazards so that persons will not be injured thereby, so that fire, police, and other public emergency services may be conducted expeditiously and safely, and so that the essential public functions served by such utilities will not be impaired constitutes a compelling governmental interest and requires a different form of regulation;\n(ix)\tWith respect to permitted vehicular signs, the council finds that regulation of bumper stickers and other forms of personal expression is inappropriate in a free and highly mobile society and that such signs are ordinarily small, whereas regulation of commercial signs on motor vehicles, which the council finds are often large, is appropriate for those who have chosen to engage in commerce within the City and serves a substantial governmental interest in aesthetics and traffic safety;\n(x)\tWith respect to permitted window signs, the council finds that such signs present no structural hazards and provide a method by which messages may be displayed on short notice by the property owner or tenant as that person perceives the need to communicate without need for any government role in the protection of the broader public interest, and that within the limitations given have not and will not cause aesthetic blight or traffic hazards of the sort unacceptable to the community; and\n(xi)\tWith respect to signs on bicycles, the council finds that the use of signs on bicycles will not cause aesthetic blight or traffic hazards of the sort unacceptable to the community and will service a substantial governmental interest by reducing the cost of an environmentally beneficial transportation option that will relieve vehicular congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve public health by providing opportunities for exercise; and\n(D)\tCouncil finds that commercial signs towed over the City by aircraft are a distraction to motorists, pedestrians, and other users of the public streets and ways, and impair traffic safety, and constitute unfair competition for earthbound advertisers who comply with the City's sign code when made by multiple passes over the City, and therefore are detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the City, and urges the Federal Aviation Administration to place suitable restrictions upon any certificate of waiver to prohibit towing such signs over the City.\n(b)\tProhibitions and Prohibited Signs:\n(1)\tConformity With Sign Code Required: No person shall display, construct, erect, alter, use, or maintain any sign in the City except in conformance with the provisions of this section.

No wall sign may be displayed on the wall of a mechanical room or penthouse or other such enclosed space which is not habitable by the occupants of the building.\n(F)\tThe length of a wall sign shall not exceed seventy percent of the length of the wall or the width of the leased space of the wall on which it is located, whichever is less.\n(G)\tThe lettering height for wall signs located within two hundred fifty feet of the right-of-way of Foothills Parkway (Colorado State Highway 157) or Pearl Parkway east of Foothills Parkway, and visible from such parkway, shall not exceed twenty-four inches.\n(H)\tThe lettering height for wall signs located within the B.V.R.C. and the BMS, MU-3, DT, and BT-2 zoning districts shall not exceed twenty-four inches for single lines of copy and a total of thirty-two inches for multiple lines of copy, and any graphic symbol may not exceed thirty inches in height.\n(I)\tA string of lights which extends on or around the perimeter of a window is subject to the following conditions: the linear length of a string of lights counts as fifty percent of the allowable square footage for wall signs. The maximum linear length of all strings of lights in windows cannot exceed ninety feet.\n(e)\tLimitations on Area, Number, and Height of Signs by Use Module:\n(1)\tUse Modules: The use modules set forth in section 9-6-1, \"Schedule of Permitted Land Uses,\" B.R.C. 1981, apply to this section, and the boundaries of such districts are determined by reference to the zoning map of the city and to interpretation of such map under section 9-5-3, \"Zoning Map,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(2)\tMaximum Sign Area Permitted: The maximum sign area permitted per property, maximum area per sign face, maximum number of signs, and maximum height of freestanding signs in the use modules in the city are as in Table 9-9 of this section, except as modified by other provisions of this section.\nTABLE 9-9: LIMITATIONS ON AREA, NUMBER, AND HEIGHT OF SIGNS BY USE MODULE\n(f)\tComputation of Signs and Sign Area:\n(1)\tRegular Shape: In computing the area of a sign, this section shall be administered using standard mathematical formulas for regular geometric shapes, including, without limitation, triangles, parallelograms, circles, ellipses, or combinations thereof.\n(2)\tIrregular Shape: In the case of an irregularly shaped sign or a sign with letters or symbols directly affixed to or painted on the wall of a building, the area of the sign is the entire area within a single continuous rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight straight lines enclosing the extreme limits of any writing, representation, emblem, or any figure of similar character, together with any material or color forming an integral part or background of the display if used to differentiate such sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but if a freestanding sign structure is not a fence which functions as such, the sign area shall be the area of the entire structure.\n(3)\tSign Structures: In computing the area of a sign, the portion of the sign structure to be included is that which is visible and viewed in the same plane as the sign face and which is made a part of the background of the display.\n(4)\tMore Than One Element: The total surface area of signs composed of more than one sign element includes the vertical and horizontal spacing between each element of the sign.\n(5)\tThree-Dimensional: For three-dimensional figure signs, the sign area is the total area, projected on a vertical plane, of each side of the sign that is visible beyond the boundaries of the property upon which the figure is located. For purposes of this paragraph, a figure is considered to have a side for each ninety degrees or part thereof of visibility from a public right-of-way.\n(6)\tAttachments: Any temporary or permanent rider or attachment to a sign or sign structure is included as part of the total sign area for the sign to which it is attached.\n(7)\tTwo Faces: A sign is computed as having two display faces if the angle between two faces is equal to or less than sixty degrees. If a sign has two or more display faces, the area of all faces and all noncontiguous surfaces is included in determining the sign area.\n(8)\tNumber of Signs: For the purpose of determining the number of signs that may be subject to the provisions of this section, a sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements clearly organized, related, and composed to form a unit. Where elements are displayed in a random manner without an organized relationship of elements or where there is reasonable doubt about the relationship of elements, each element shall be considered to be a single sign.\n(9)\tOne Use of Building Frontage: Building frontage used as the basis of determining permitted sign area for one use may not be used again as the basis for determining the permitted sign area for another use, but nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the additional use from erecting a sign that would otherwise be authorized by the provisions of this section.\n(10)\tMore Than One Frontage: For the purpose of determining the total allowable sign area for buildings with more than one frontage, the following criteria apply:\n(A)\tIf a building has more than one frontage, the maximum sign area for the building is based on the total horizontal length of not more than two contiguous frontages; and\n(B)\tSigns may be located on any side of the building, but the total sign area on any one side of the building may not exceed the area permitted on the basis of that frontage considered independently of other frontages.\n(g)\tPermits and Applications:\n(1)\tThe owner or tenant of property on which a sign is to be located or an authorized agent thereof or a sign contractor licensed by the city shall apply for a sign permit in writing on a form furnished by the city manager, shall sign the application, and shall pay the fee prescribed in section 4-20-21, \"Sign Contractor License Fees and Sign Permit Fees,\" B.R.C. 1981. There is no fee for signs placed by a homeowner on residential property, for banners, or for exempt signs.\n(2)\tThe owner of a multi-tenant or multiple use property or an agent of the owner shall apply for all sign permits for the property or shall develop a plan for apportioning permitted sign area among tenants and file such plan with the city manager, in which case each tenant may apply for a sign permit in conformity with the plan.\n(3)\tThe applicant shall submit the following information as part of the application:\n(A)\tThe name, address, and telephone number of the owner or persons entitled to possession of the sign and of the sign contractor or installer;\n(B)\tThe street address or location of the proposed sign;\n(C)\tComplete information required on application forms provided by the city manager, including a site plan and elevation drawings of the proposed sign, copy of the proposed sign, and other data pertinent to the application;\n(D)\tPlans indicating the scope and structural detail of the work to be done, including details of all connections, guy lines, supports, footings, and materials to be used;\n(E)\tComplete application for an electrical permit for all electric signs if the person building the sign is to make the electrical connection; and\n(F)\tStatement of the sign's valuation.\n(4)\tWithin five working days of the date of the application, the city manager will either approve or deny the application or refer it back to the applicant for further information.\n(5)\tNo person issued a sign permit under this section shall change, modify, alter, or otherwise deviate from the terms or conditions of the approved application or permit without first requesting and obtaining approval to do so from the city manager.\n(6)\tIf the sign conforms to all other applicable requirements of this section, no permit is required for maintenance of the sign.\n(h)\tExpiration of Permit:\n(1)\tIf a person to whom a permit is granted under this section has not commenced work on the sign within sixty days from the date on which the permit was issued or if substantial building operations under such permit are suspended for a period of 60 consecutive days, the permit automatically expires, but the city manager may grant an extension of the time limits provided in this paragraph for construction delays that are not the result of willful acts or neglect by the permittee, upon a written request for such an extension received by the manager before expiration of the permit.\n(2)\tThe city manager shall not refund any permit fees paid under this section if any permit is revoked pursuant to subsection (t) of this section, or expires under this subsection.\n(i)\tInspections:\n(1)\tIn enforcing the provisions of this section, the city manager may enter any building, structure, or premises in the city at reasonable times to perform any duty imposed by this section.\n(2)\tThe city manager may require footing inspections on the day of excavation for a freestanding sign.\n(3)\tThe city manager may require inspection of an electrical sign before its erection within forty-eight hours after being notified that the sign is ready for inspection.\n(4)\tA permit holder or agent thereof shall notify the city manager when a sign is complete and ready for final inspection, which shall be no more than sixty days after work is commenced.\n(j)\tLicensed Sign Contractor Required to Install Signs: No person other than a sign contractor licensed under chapter 4-21, \"Sign Contractor License,\" B.R.C. 1981, shall install any sign for which a permit is required under this section, except:\n(1)\tA homeowner may install a sign on the premises of such person's residence, for which a permit is otherwise required, if the homeowner obtains a permit and complies with all requirements of this section other than that of licensed sign contractor installation.\n(2)\tBanner signs for which permits are required.\n(3)\tWindow signs for which permits are required.\n(k)\tSigns in Approved Site Review Developments:\n(1)\tA sign located in an approved site review development shall conform to all requirements of this section, including those of the district in which the property is located, except for those subsections dealing with sign setbacks from property lines and spacing between projecting and freestanding signs if alternative setbacks and spacing are specifically shown on a site plan approved under section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981, or approved as part of a sign program for the site review project. In no case may the total square footage for signage permitted under this section be increased through a site review or sign program.\n(2)\tSign lettering and graphic symbol height as specified in subparagraph (d)(14)(H) of this section concerning wall signs may also be varied in accordance with paragraph (k)(1) of this section.\n(3)\tIf a condition of site review development approval requires a uniform sign program, the following additional conditions shall apply:\n(A)\tThe owner or developer of the site review development shall submit a uniform sign program to the city manager for approval prior to the issuance of any sign permits within the planned unit development. Such program shall include, as a minimum:\n(i)\tType of sign permitted (wall sign, projecting sign, awning sign, window sign, etc.).\n(ii)\tType of construction (individual letters, cabinet, internal or indirect illumination, etc.).\n(iii)\tColor.\n(iv)\tSize of sign (maximum height of letters, maximum length of sign, and maximum size).\n(v)\tLocation of sign.\n(B)\tThe aggregate area of all signs and the size of any freestanding sign shall not exceed that permitted in subsection (e) of this section.\n(C)\tThe owner or developer of the site review development shall notify all potential tenants or property owners of the sign program at the time of sale or lease of the property.\n(D)\tThe property owner or developer or an authorized representative shall review all signs for compliance with the sign program prior to a tenant applying for a sign permit and shall countersign the application signifying such compliance.\n(E)\tThe sign program may not be altered without written permission of the city manager. In addition, no changes may be made without the written permission of a majority of tenants whose existing signs are in compliance with the previously established sign program.\n(4)\tThe city manager shall apply the following standards in approving or denying a sign program or request to alter a sign program:\n(A)\tAll signs shall be in compliance with law;\n(B)\tThe program shall ensure a reasonable degree of sign uniformity and coordination within the program area and will enhance the visual quality of the area;\n(C)\tThe program shall be simple, clear, and to the point;\n(D)\tThe program shall limit the number of signs allowed for each tenant of the area;\n(E)\tSigns shall be compatible with the area in color, shape, and materials;\n(F)\tA color plan for signs is required;\n(G)\tSigns are simple and clearly legible;\n(H)\tFreestanding signs are integrated in appearance with their surroundings; and\n(I)\tThe city manager shall not consider the content of the sign.\n(5)\tThe city manager may write uniform sign program guidelines to serve as an example of a sign program which meets the requirements of this subsection.\n(l)\tStructural Design Requirements:\n(1)\tSigns and sign structures shall be designed and constructed as specified in this subsection to resist wind and seismic forces. All bracing systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer lateral forces to the foundations. For signs on buildings, the dead and lateral loads shall be transmitted through the structural frame of the building to the ground so as not to overstress any of the elements thereof. The overturning moment produced from lateral forces may not exceed two-thirds of the dead load resisting moment. The structural frame of the building or the anchoring of the sign shall be adequate to resist uplift due to overturning. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead load resisting moment, if it is carefully placed and thoroughly compacted.\n(2)\tSigns and sign structures shall be designed and constructed in compliance with the city building code, chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981, including all requirements to resist seismic forces.\n(3)\tWind loads and seismic loads need not be combined in the design of signs or sign structures. Signs shall be designed to withstand the loading that produces the larger stresses. Vertical design loads, other than roof live loads, shall be assumed to be acting simultaneously with the wind or seismic loads.\n(4)\tThe design of structural members shall conform to the requirements of the city building code, chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981. Vertical and horizontal loads exerted on the soil shall not produce stresses exceeding those specified in the city building code.\n(5)\tThe working stresses of wire rope and its fastenings shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the ultimate strength of the rope or fastening. Working stresses for wind loads combined with dead loads may be increased as specified in the city building code, chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(m)\tConstruction Standards:\n(1)\tSigns and sign structures shall be securely built, constructed, and erected in conformity with the requirements of this subsection.\n(2)\tSupports for signs or sign structures shall not be placed on property not owned or leased by the sign owner.\n(3)\tMaterials of construction for signs and sign structures shall be of the quality and grade specified for buildings in the city building code, chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981. Plastic materials shall be those specified in the building code that have a flame spread rating of 0-25 or less and a smoke density no greater than that obtained from the burning of untreated wood under similar conditions when tested in accordance with the building code standards in the way intended for use. The products of combustion shall be no more toxic than the burning of untreated wood under similar conditions.\n(4)\tAll sign structures, except for construction signs, those signs specifically excepted in subparagraphs (c)(1)(A), (c)(1)(E), (c)(1)(G), (c)(1)(H), (c)(1)(J), and (c)(1)(L) of this section, window signs, and signs located inside buildings, shall have structural members of heavy timber or incombustible material. Wall signs, projecting signs, and awning signs shall be constructed of incombustible material, except as provided in paragraph (m)(5) of this section or as specifically approved by the city manager. No combustible materials other than approved plastic shall be used in the construction of electric signs.\n(5)\tNonstructural elements of a sign may be of wood, metal, approved plastic, or any combination thereof.\n(6)\tMembers supporting unbraced signs shall be so proportioned that the bearing loads imposed on the soil either vertically or horizontally do not exceed safe values. Braced ground signs shall be anchored to resist specified wind or seismic loads acting in any direction. Anchors and supports shall be designed for safe bearing loads on the soil for effective resistance to pull-out amounting to a force of twenty-five percent greater than the required resistance to a depth of not less than three feet. Anchors and supports shall be guarded and protected when near driveways, parking lots, or similar locations where they could be damaged by moving vehicles.\n(7)\tSigns attached to masonry, concrete, or steel shall be safely and securely fastened thereto by means of metal anchors, bolts, or approved expansion screws of sufficient size and anchorage to support safely the loads applied.\n(8)\tNo anchor or support of any sign, except flat wall signs, shall be connected to or supported by an unbraced parapet wall.\n(9)\tDisplay surfaces in all types of signs shall be of metal or other approved materials.\n(10)\tSigns intended for temporary placement of less than six months and which have no electrical or other special features:\n(A)\tIf less than six square feet per face and under four feet in height, may be constructed of any sturdy material and shall be anchored securely to the ground or a building, fence, or other structure and may be supported by any suitable support which will withstand the wind loading.\n(B)\tA freestanding sign more than six square feet in area or four feet or more in height shall have at least two supports pounded at least two feet into the ground.\n(C)\tConstruction site signs placed over concrete or asphalt or other materials into which posts may not conveniently be driven may instead be held in place by weights sufficient to withstand the wind.\n(11)\tThe city manager may approve the use of any material if an applicant submits sufficient technical data to substantiate such proposed use and if the manager determines that such material is satisfactory for the use intended.\n(12)\tWhere any freestanding sign has a clearance of less than eight feet from the ground, there shall be provided a barrier or other adequate protection to prevent hazard to pedestrians and motorists.\n(n)\tElectric Signs:\n(1)\tAn electric sign shall be constructed of incombustible material. An electric sign shall be rain tight, but service holes fitted with waterproof covers may be provided to each compartment of such sign. All electric signs installed or erected in the city shall bear the label of Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., on the exterior of the sign.\n(2)\tNo electric sign shall be erected or maintained that does not comply with the city electrical code, Chapter 10-6, \"Electrical Code,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tNo electric equipment or electrical apparatus of any kind that causes interference with radio or television reception shall be used in the operation of an illuminated sign. Whenever interference is caused by a sign that is unfiltered, improperly filtered, or otherwise defective, or by any other electrical device or apparatus connected to the sign, the city manager may order the sign disconnected until it is repaired.\n(o)\tSign Maintenance: No person shall fail to maintain a sign on such person's premises, including signs exempt from the permit requirements by subsection (c) of this section, in good structural condition at all times. All signs, including all metal parts and supports thereof that are not galvanized or of rust-resistant metals, shall be kept neatly painted. The city manager is authorized to inspect and may order the painting, repair, alteration, or removal of a sign that constitutes a hazard to safety, health, or public welfare because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or obsolescence, under the procedures prescribed by subsection (t) of this section.\n(p)\tContinuation of Legal Nonconforming Signs: A legal nonconforming sign that is not required to be discontinued under the provisions of subsection (q) of this section, may be continued and shall be maintained in good condition as required by subsection (o) of this section, but it shall not be:\n(1)\tStructurally changed to another nonconforming sign, to a degree that would require a sign permit;\n(2)\tStructurally altered in order to prolong the life of the sign, except to meet safety requirements;\n(3)\tAltered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign;\n(4)\tExpanded;\n(5)\tRe-established after its discontinuance for ninety days;\n(6)\tContinued in use after cessation or change of the business or activity to which the sign pertains;\n(7)\tRe-established after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction exceeds fifty percent of the appraised replacement cost as determined by the city manager; or\n(8)\tIf the landmarks board finds that a sign which otherwise would violate this section was, before January 6, 1972, an integral part of a building, since designated as a landmark, or in a historic district since designated, pursuant to Chapter 9-11, \"Historic Preservation,\" B.R.C. 1981, and is a substantial aspect of the pre-1972 historic character of such building, then such a sign is exempt from the provisions of paragraphs (p)(2), (p)(6), and (p)(7) of this section, and the period of discontinuance for such a sign in paragraph (p)(5) of this section shall be one year.\n(q)\tDiscontinuance of Prohibited Legal Nonconforming Signs:\n(1)\tExcept as provided in paragraph (q)(2) or (q)(3) of this section, a legal nonconforming sign prohibited by subsection (b) of this section shall be removed or brought into conformity with the provisions of this section within sixty days from the date on which the sign became nonconforming.\n(2)\tA legal nonconforming sign described in subparagraph (b)(3)(C), (b)(3)(D), (b)(3)(H), or (b)(3)(K) of this section is subject to the amortization provisions of subsection (r) of this section, unless excepted by paragraph (q)(3) of this section.\n(3)\tExisting legal signs in the city which became nonconforming solely because of a change in this sign code enacted by Ordinance No. 5186 (1989) or Ordinance No. 6017 (1998) are subject to all the requirements of subsection (p) of this section, but are not subject to the sixty-day discontinuance provisions of paragraph (q)(1) of this section or the amortization provisions of subsection (r) of this section. Such amortization provisions are also inapplicable to lawfully permitted nonconforming advertising devices, as those terms are defined and applied in the Outdoor Advertising Act, 43-1-401 et seq., C.R.S. The city manager is authorized, subject to appropriation, to remove such devices by eminent domain proceedings.\n(r)\tAmortization Provisions: Except for signs described in paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(3) of this section, or a temporary sign, a legal nonconforming sign shall be brought into conformity or removed under the following schedule:\n(1)\tA sign that exceeds the maximum area or height limitations of this section by twenty percent or less will be treated as a conforming sign and need not be removed or altered, but if such sign is replaced or renovated it shall conform to all requirements of this section.\n(2)\tA sign having an original cost of $100.00 or less shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of this section or removed within sixty days after the date on which the sign became nonconforming under this section.\n(3)\tA sign having an original cost exceeding $100.00 that is nonconforming only in the respect that it does not meet the requirements of this section concerning height, setback, distance between signs on the same or adjacent properties, or limitations on window signs, shall be brought into conformity with the requirements of this section or removed or a contract for timely completion of such work shall be executed within one hundred eighty days after the date upon which the sign became nonconforming under this section.\n(4)\tA sign having an original cost exceeding $100.00 that is nonconforming as to permitted sign area or any other provision of this section that would require the complete removal or total replacement of the sign may be maintained for the longer of the following periods:\n(A)\tThree years from the date upon which the sign became nonconforming under the provisions of this section by annexation or code amendment; or\n(B)\tA period of three to seven years from the installation date or most recent renovation date that preceded the date on which the sign became nonconforming. But if the date of renovation is chosen as the starting date of the amortization period, such period of amortization shall be calculated according to the cost of the renovation and not according to the original cost of the sign. The amortization periods in Table 9-10 of this section apply according to the original cost of the sign, including installation costs, or of the renovation:\nTABLE 9-10: AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE\n(5)\tTo be eligible for an amortization period longer than three years pursuant to subparagraph (r)(4)(B) of this section, the owner of a sign shall, within one year from the date on which the sign became nonconforming, file with the city manager a statement setting forth the cost of such nonconforming sign, the date of erection or the cost and date of most recent renovation, and a written agreement to remove or bring the nonconforming sign into conformity with all provisions of this section at or before the expiration of the amortization period applicable to the sign.\n(s)\tAppeals and Variances:\n(1)\tAny aggrieved person who contests an interpretation of this section which causes denial of a permit, or who believes a violation alleged in a notice of violation issued pursuant to paragraph (t)(2) or (t)(3) of this section, to be factually or legally incorrect, may appeal the denial or notice of violation to the BOZA or board of building appeals in a manner provided by either such board under the procedures prescribed by Chapter 1-3, \"Quasi-Judicial Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981, or may, in the case of a denial, request that a variance be granted. An appeal from a denial and a request for a variance may be filed in the alternative.\n(A)\tAn appeal from an interpretation which causes denial of a permit or from a notice alleging a violation of subsections (l), (m), (n), and (o) of this section shall be filed with the BOZA.\n(B)\tAn appeal from any other interpretation alleging any other violation of this section shall be filed with the BOZA.\n(C)\tAn appellant shall file the appeal, request for variance, or both in the alternative with the BOZA within fifteen days from the date of notice of the denial or the date of service of the notice of violation. The appellant may request more time to file. If the appellant makes such request before the end of the time period and shows good cause therefore, the city manager may extend for a reasonable period the time to file with either board.\n(2)\tNo person may appeal to or request a variance from the BOZA if the person has displayed, constructed, erected, altered, or relocated a sign without a sign permit required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The boards have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal nor authority to grant any variance from the permit requirements of this section. But the BOZA has jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a notice of violation alleging violation of the permit requirements if the appeal is from the manager's interpretation that a permit is required, and the appellant's position is that the device is not a sign or that it is exempt from the permit requirements under subsection (c) of this section.\n(3)\tAn applicant for an appeal or a variance under this subsection shall pay the fee prescribed by Subsection 4-20-47(b), B.R.C. 1981.\n(4)\tSetbacks, spacing of freestanding and projecting signs, and sign noise limitations are the only requirements which the BOZA may vary. If an applicant requests that the BOZA grant such a variance, the board shall not grant a variance unless it finds that each of the following conditions exists:\n(A)\tThere are special physical circumstances or physical conditions, including, without limitation, buildings, topography, vegetation, sign structures, or other physical features on adjacent properties or within the adjacent public right-of-way that would substantially restrict the effectiveness of the sign in question, and such special circumstances or conditions are peculiar to the particular business or enterprise to which the applicant desires to draw attention and do not apply generally to all businesses or enterprises in the area; or\n(B)\tFor variances from the noise limitations of subparagraph (b)(3)(L) of this section, the proposed variance is temporary in duration (not to exceed thirty days) and consists of a temporary exhibition of auditory art; and\n(C)\tThe variance would be consistent with the purposes of this section and would not adversely affect the neighborhood in which the business or enterprise or exhibition to which the applicant desires to draw attention is located; and\n(D)\tThe variance is the minimum one necessary to permit the applicant reasonably to draw attention to its business, enterprise, or exhibition.\n(5)\tIf an applicant requests that the board of building appeals approve alternate materials or methods of construction or modifications from the requirements of subsections (l), (m), (n), and (o) of this section, the board may approve the same under the standards and procedures provided in the city building code, Chapter 10-5, \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(6)\tExcept as provided in paragraph (s)(7) of this section, the BOZA has no jurisdiction to hear a request for nor authority to grant a variance that would increase the maximum permitted sign area on a single property or building, or from the prohibitions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. But the BOZA has jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a permit denial or of a notice of violation alleging that a sign would exceed the maximum permitted sign area or is prohibited if the appellant's position is that the sign does not exceed such area or is not prohibited by such paragraph.\n(7)\tThe BOZA or board of building appeals may make any variance or alternate material or method approval or modification it grants subject to any reasonable conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to make the device that is permitted by the variance compatible with the purposes of this section.\n(8)\tThe city manager's denial or notice of violation becomes a final order of the BOZA or board of building appeals if:\n(A)\tThe applicant fails to appeal the manager's denial or order to the board within the prescribed time limit;\n(B)\tThe applicant fails to appeal the order of the board to a court of competent jurisdiction within the prescribed time limit; or\n(C)\tA court of competent jurisdiction enters a final order and judgment upon an appeal filed from a decision of the board under this section.\n(t)\tEnforcement:\n(1)\tThe city manager may enforce the provisions of this section in any one or more of the following ways:\n(A)\tBy issuing a criminal summons and complaint, followed by prosecution in municipal court.\n(B)\tIf the city manager desires to use self-help to remove a sign for which a permit has been issued, by issuing a notice of violation, revoking a permit, removing a sign, and collecting the cost of removal pursuant to paragraph (t)(2) of this section.\n(C)\tIf the city manager desires to use self-help to remove or correct a sign for which no permit has been issued, by issuing a notice of violation, correcting the violation, and collecting the cost of correction pursuant to paragraph (t)(3) of this section.\n(D)\tBy removing any sign posted in violation of Subsection 5-4-15(a), B.R.C. 1981, concerning posting signs on government property. Such signs are a public nuisance. After such removal the manager may also file a civil complaint in municipal court against the person who posted the sign or the beneficiary of the sign or both. The court shall award the city as damages the costs of removal of the sign and restoration of the surface upon which it was posted. This judgment shall be enforceable as any civil judgment.\n(E)\tBy filing a civil complaint for declaratory or injunctive relief in District Court.\nThese remedies are cumulative and not exclusive, and use of one does not foreclose use of any other also.\n(2)\tIf the city manager finds that any sign for which a permit has been issued does not comply with the permit or approved permit application or violates any provision of this section or any other ordinance of the city, the manager may send a notice of violation to the owner of the sign by first class mail to the address on the sign permit application. The notice shall state the violation, and any required corrections, and that if the corrections are not made within thirty days or an appeal filed within fifteen days pursuant to subsection (s) of this section, the permit shall be revoked, and the manager may then proceed as specified in paragraphs (t)(4) and (t)(5) of this section.\n(3)\tThe city manager may issue a notice of violation ordering the sign owner or possessor or property owner to alter or remove a sign which is in violation of this section and for which no permit has been issued within thirty days from the date of the notice. Notice under this paragraph is sufficient if it is mailed first class to the address of the last known owner of the real property on which the sign is located as shown on the records of the Boulder County Assessor. The notice shall state the violation, order removal of the sign or state any reasonable corrections which would bring the sign into compliance with this section, and that if removal or correction is not accomplished within thirty days or an appeal filed within fifteen days pursuant to subsection (s) of this section, the manager may proceed as specified in paragraphs (t)(4) and (t)(5) of this section. If the violation is of paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, the manager may require removal of the illegal sign within one day from the date of actual notice or five days from the date of mailing of mailed notice.\n(4)\tIf the property owner or sign owner or possessor fails to complete alteration or removal as required by the notice given as prescribed by paragraph (t)(2) or (t)(3) of this section, or to appeal pursuant to subsection (s) of this section, or loses such appeal and it becomes a final order pursuant to paragraph (s)(8) of this section, the city manager may cause such sign to be altered or removed at the expense of the owner or possessor of the property or sign and charge the costs thereof to such person.\n(5)\tIf any property owner fails or refuses to pay when due any charge imposed under this subsection, the city manager may, in addition to taking other collection remedies, certify due and unpaid charges, including interest, to the Boulder County Treasurer to be levied against the person's property for collection by the county in the same manner as delinquent general taxes upon such property are collected, as provided in Section 2-2-12, \"City Manager May Certify Taxes, Charges, and Assessments to County Treasurer for Collection,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(6)\tThe penalty for violation of any provision of this section is a fine of not more than $2,000.00 per violation. In addition, upon conviction of any person for violation of this section, the court may issue a cease and desist order and any other orders reasonably calculated to remedy the violation. Violation of any order of the court issued under this subsection is a violation of this subsection, and is punishable by a fine of not more than $4,000.00 per violation, or incarceration for not more than ninety days in jail, or both such fine and incarceration.\n(u)\tRules and Regulations: The city manager is authorized to adopt reasonable procedural rules and interpretive regulations consistent with the provisions of this section to aid in its implementation and enforcement.\n(v)\tCompliance With State Law Required: In addition to compliance with this section, all signs to which the provisions of the Outdoor Advertising Act, 43-1-401 et seq., C.R.S., and its supplemental regulations apply shall comply with such Act and regulations. Signs which do not so comply shall be deemed illegal nonconforming signs under this section.\n(w)\tSubstitution Clause: It is the intention of the city council that this sign code not favor commercial over noncommercial messages. However, all sign codes are complex, and sometimes when provisions which do not appear to be related are read together, unintended results may occur. If any provision of this code is judicially construed to allow a commercial message but not a noncommercial message, then the property owner may substitute any noncommercial message under the same limitations as to physical characteristics and location of the sign as would apply to a commercial message on such sign.\nOrdinance Nos. 4879 (1984); 5186 (1989); 5223 (1989); 5255 (1989); 5377 (1991); 5562 (1993); 5639 (1994); 5640 (1994); 5930 (1997); 7332 (2004); 7365 (2004); 7484 (2006); 7522 (2007); 7777 (2011); 8005 (2014); 8038 (2015); 8111 (2016); 8696 (2025)",

    "verbatim": "(a)\tPurpose. The purpose of this section is to provide the trip generation requirements for the MU-4, RH-6 and RH-7 zoning districts for developments that are not served by a general improvement district or other approved organization that provides transportation related services. Further, it is the purpose of this section to:\n(1)\tProvide approaches to mitigate the impacts of traffic generated by development and redevelopment.\n(2)\tEnsure that the amount of land used for parking is the minimum necessary to serve development in the area.\n(3)\tProvide opportunities for parking that is provided in a development to be used in an efficient manner during all times of the day or evening.\n(b)\tScope. The applicant for any additional floor area for a property located in the MU-4, RH-6 and RH-7 zoning districts shall demonstrate that the development does not exceed the trip generation allowance standards of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to development proposals within general improvement districts or other organizations that have service plans which include transportation demand management and parking management programs that have been approved by the city council to generally meet the objectives described in this section.\n(c)\tTrip Generation Allowance. The applicant for any development subject to the requirements of this section shall demonstrate that a certain percentage of trips generated by the development during the highest peak travel time will be by alternative modes or avoided, as specified below:\n(1)\tIn all areas except the Alpine-Balsam and East Boulder areas identified in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" B.R.C. 1981, at least fifty-five percent of the trips generated by the development shall be by alternative modes or avoided.\n(2)\tIn the Alpine-Balsam form-based code area, at least 30 percent of the trips generated by the development shall be by alternative modes or avoided.\n(3)\tIn the East Boulder form-based code areas, at least 30 percent of the trips generated by the development shall be by alternative modes or avoided.\n(4)\tAlternative modes are modes of transportation other than single occupant motor-vehicle use and include, without limitation, walking, bicycling, carpooling, vanpooling, micromobility, or public transportation.\n(5)\tTrips are avoided through programs such as alternate work schedules, including telecommuting or compressed work week programs.\n(d)\tTrip Generation Calculation. The trip generation allowance shall be calculated using standard calculation methods commonly accepted by the Institute of Traffic Engineers for the uses of land that are proposed for the development during the highest peak travel times. The applicant shall provide the city manager with information necessary to demonstrate that the appropriate number of trips for the proposed development has been provided.\n(e)\tTrip Reduction and Mitigation. The applicant shall demonstrate how it will achieve the alternative mode use and trip avoidance required pursuant to subsection (c) at the highest peak travel time through a transportation demand management plan.\n(f)\tTransportation Demand Management Plan. A transportation demand management plan shall be submitted with all development applications that add a nonresidential use floor area or an additional dwelling unit that demonstrates compliance with the trip generation requirements. Any combination of the following methods may be incorporated into the transportation demand management plan to achieve the requirements of this section.\n(1)\tParking management strategies.\n(2)\tEnhanced design and amenities.\n(3)\tFinancial incentives.\n(4)\tTrip reduction and avoidance programs and policies.\n(5)\tMarketing and outreach.\n(g)\tComponents of a Transportation Demand Management Plan. An applicant may divide a transportation demand management plan into two components: (1) infrastructure and amenities; and (2) a transportation demand management operations program. As part of a development approval, the city manager will approve separate trip generation reductions attributable to each element of the transportation demand management plan.\n(1)\tInfrastructure and Amenities. The infrastructure and amenities component of the transportation demand management plan shall include all of the elements of the transportation demand management plan that require the construction of either private or public improvements. The improvements may include, without limitation, facilities such as showers and changing facilities, parking area design, amenities that support alternate mode use such as covered and secure bicycle parking or enhanced pedestrian, bicycle and transit access. Unless otherwise approved in the infrastructure and amenities plan, all public and private improvements shall be constructed prior to or concurrent with the construction of the buildings within the development. If construction of such improvements is to occur later, the applicant shall submit, subject to the review and approval of the city manager, an improvement construction phasing plan. The applicant shall demonstrate that phasing of the construction of improvements is necessary because such improvement cannot be effectively or efficiently utilized until a given level of development has been completed on the property.\n(2)\tDemand Management Operations Program. The demand management operations program shall be the plan that is used by the tenant or occupant of a development or a portion thereof. The demand management operations plan shall include those programs necessary to meet the trip reduction requirements of this section, including without limitation the following:\n(A)\tParking management strategies that may include unbundled parking, paid parking areas or carpool or vanpool preferred parking areas.\n(B)\tActive promotion of alternate modes through marketing and outreach programs to employees or residents.\n(C)\tFinancial incentives for employees or residents to alternate modes such as public transit passes, subsidized transit or vanpool fares or a parking cash-out program.\n(D)\tPolicies and programs including bicycle or carshare services, telework stations in residential buildings or telecommuting and compressed work week programs for employees.\n(E)\tA plan for monitoring the effectiveness of the transportation demand management plan that is submitted to the city manager on a biannual basis, using guidelines and performance measures developed by the city. The monitoring plan shall state whether the monitoring shall be done by the owner, occupant, tenant or other designated organization.\n(3)\tSustainable Funding. The costs of a transportation demand management program shall be the responsibility of the owner, occupants, tenants or visitors to the development. The applicant shall be required to demonstrate how the facilities and programs will be initially funded and funded over time to ensure implementation and ongoing operation of the facilities and programs.\n(h)\tMonitoring and Evaluation. The owner of any property that has a transportation demand management plan shall be responsible for ensuring that the monitoring and evaluation component of the transportation demand management plan is completed as required by this section. Monitoring and evaluation data shall be submitted to the city manager on a biannual basis. The monitoring and evaluation data shall be in a form acceptable to the city manager and shall address the effectiveness of the approved transportation demand management plan in reaching the trip generation requirements of this section. If the monitoring data shows that the transportation demand management plan is not meeting the trip generation requirements of this section, the owner shall submit a revised transportation demand management plan that meets the requirements of this section within thirty days of a request by the city manager.\n(i)\tCity Manager May Issue Rules. The city manager may adopt rules necessary for the implementation and interpretation of this chapter under the procedures of Chapter 1-4, \"Rulemaking,\" B.R.C. 1981. Such rules may address, without limitation, the following topics:\n(1)\tMethods for determining how programs and facilities impact trip generation rates;\n(2)\tMethods of evaluating approved travel demand management plans during the biannual review processes; and\n(3)\tMonitoring procedures and practices for approved travel demand management plans.\n(j)\tCompliance Required. No person shall fail to comply with the requirements of this section or any rule issued by the city manager under this section. No person shall fail to submit the operations monitoring component of a demand management operations plan to the city manager on at least an annual basis. No person shall violate the terms of an approved travel demand management plan.\nOrdinance Nos. 7655 (2009); 8668 (2024); 8669 (2025)",
