When rezoning to a flex district, the rezoning ordinance shall identify the specific use, form, and intensity modules which shall be identified on the official zoning map. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent city council from creating new zoning districts.\nOrdinance Nos. 7484 (2006); 7522 (2007); 7571 (2007); 7655 (2009); 7887 (2013); 8556 (2023); 8599 (2024); 8620 (2024); 8651 (2025); 8697 (2025)",
