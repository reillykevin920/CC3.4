The approving authority will not approve a management plan unless it adequately addresses such impacts. The following standards apply to the preparation, submission, and approval of a management plan:\n(1)\tElements of a Management Plan: The management plan shall contain the following components that describe the business operation and address the mitigation of potential adverse impacts the facility may have on the surrounding neighborhood, to the extent necessary, including, without limitation:\n(A)\tA description of the food service offered;\n(B)\tHours of operation;\n(C)\tClient and visitor arrival and departure times;\n(D)\tCoordinated times for deliveries and trash collection;\n(E)\tA description of the type of entertainment provided;\n(F)\tSize, location, and number of electronic amplifiers;\n(G)\tTechniques and strategies to mitigate noise impacts;\n(H)\tA description of how the applicant will prevent littering and maintain an orderly appearance of the premises and any adjacent right-of-way;\n(I)\tA security plan describing security features, including, without limitation, personnel and equipment;\n(J)\tThe facility's drug and alcohol policy;\n(K)\tStrategies to avoid loitering;\n(L)\tEmployee education;\n(M)\tThe facility's responsibilities as good neighbors;\n(N)\tNeighborhood outreach and methods for future communication; and\n(O)\tDispute resolution strategies for any conflicts with the surrounding neighborhood.\n(2)\tPreparation and Distribution of a Proposed Management Plan: The owner or operator shall prepare a proposed management plan and present it to the surrounding property owners at the good neighbor meeting required by Subsection (a) of this section.\n(3)\tSubmission of a Management Plan: After the good neighbor meeting, the applicant shall submit a revised management plan with its application.\n(4)\tApproved Management Plan: An approved management plan shall be used to define the operating characteristics of a facility and shall be retained by the applicant and the city manager and shall be readily available to any member of the public at all times during business hours. No person shall operate a facility in violation of an approved management plan.\n(5)\tAmendment of a Management Plan: When the owner or operator changes the operating characteristics in a manner that does not comply with the approved management plan, the owner or operator shall resubmit a management plan. No owner or operator shall fail to resubmit a management plan that meets the requirements of this section. The city manager is authorized to require an owner or operator to organize, host, and participate in a good neighbor meeting if the city manager determines that such a meeting will be of assistance in identifying additional adverse impacts that may have been created by the facility. The amended management plan shall address how the facility will address any additional adverse impacts that have been identified by the city manager. The city manager will approve the amended management plan upon finding that any such additional adverse impacts will be mitigated by amendments to the management plan.\n(6)\tManagement Plan as a Condition of a Use Review Approval: A management plan shall be incorporated into the conditions of approval if the applicant is required to complete a use review pursuant to Section 9-2-15, \"Use Review,\" B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance Nos. 7522 (2007); 7938 (2013)",

The scope of staff comments will differ from application to application, at the discretion of the manager. Unless withdrawn, a concept plan shall be referred to the planning board pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this subsection and may be reviewed by the city council pursuant to Paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n(1)\tPlanning Board Review and Comment: The manager will forward the application, any comments received from neighbors and other interested persons, and any staff comments to the planning board. The planning board shall review the concept plan at a public meeting held pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 2-3-1(b), B.R.C. 1981. Planning board members may provide individual comments on the concept plan.\n(2)\tCity Council Call-Up: The city council may call up a concept plan application within thirty days of the board's review. The manager may extend the call-up period until the council's next regular meeting, if the manager finds in writing within the original call-up period that the council will not receive notice of the application in time to enable it to call up the application.

    "heading": "Site Review.",
    "verbatim": "(a)\tPurpose: The purpose of site review is to allow flexibility in design, to encourage innovation in land use development, to promote the most appropriate use of land, to improve the character and quality of new development, to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities, to preserve the natural and scenic features of open space, to ensure compatible architecture, massing and height of buildings with existing, approved, and known to be planned or projected buildings in the immediate area, to ensure human scale development, to promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians, bicyclists and other modes within and around developments and to implement the goals and policies of the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans of the community. Review criteria are established to achieve the following:\n1.\tConsistency with the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan (BVCP): Development projects are consistent with relevant goals and policies of the BVCP, while recognizing that no project must satisfy one particular goal or policy or all of them.\n2.\tConsistency with Adopted Plans: Development projects are consistent with adopted subcommunity and area plans and design guidelines of the city.\n3.\tSustainability: Projects are designed to be sustainable and address greenhouse gas emissions and to prevent or mitigate impacts to the natural environment.\n4.\tHousing Diversity: Residential projects assist the community in producing a variety of housing types and unit sizes.\n5.\tEnhanced Site Design: Projects preserve and enhance the community's unique sense of place through creative design that respects historic character and the project's relationship to the natural environment, public realm, and surrounding area. The project provides multi-modal transportation connectivity and promotes use of modes other than the single-occupant vehicles. Site open space enhances the pedestrian experience, is functional, and incorporates high-quality sustainable landscaping. Open space meets the needs of the users of the project.\n6.\tEnduring Human Scale Building Design: Buildings exemplify high-quality, enduring architecture with facades that are simple and human scaled. Buildings provide pedestrian interest and are consistent with the character established in adopted subcommunity or area plans or design guidelines or, if none apply, are compatible with the character of the surrounding area or improve upon that character.\n7.\tCommunity Benefit and Enhanced Building and Site Design for Taller, Larger Buildings: Buildings that are built above the by-right zoning district height limits or floor area ratio maximums as may be approved under the standards of this section provide community benefits identified in the BVCP beyond the underlying zoning. These buildings are compatible in form and massing with the surrounding area and preserve and take advantage of prominent views from the site and adjacent public spaces and provide high quality open space that provides relief to the additional height and intensity of the project and the surrounding area.\n(b)\tScope: The following development review thresholds apply to any development that is eligible or that otherwise may be required to complete the site review process:\n(1)\tDevelopment Review Thresholds:\n(A)\tMinimum Thresholds for Voluntary Site Review: No person may apply for a site review application unless the project exceeds the thresholds for the \"minimum size for site review\" category set forth in Table 2-2 of this section or a height modification pursuant to Subparagraph (E) below on any lot is requested.\n(B)\tMinimum Thresholds for Required Site Review: No person may apply for a subdivision or a building permit for a project that exceeds the thresholds for the \"concept plan and site review required\" category set forth in table 2-2 of this section until a site review has been completed.\n(C)\tCommon Ownership: All contiguous lots or parcels under common ownership or control, not subject to a planned development, planned residential development, planned unit development, or site review approval, shall be considered as one property for the purposes of determining whether the maximum site review thresholds below apply. If such lots or parcels cross zoning district boundaries, the lesser threshold of the zoning districts shall apply to all of the lots or parcels.\n(D)\tPreviously Approved Developments: Previously approved valid planned unit developments that do not otherwise meet the minimum site review thresholds may be modified or amended consistent with the provisions of this title pursuant to Subsections (k) and (l) of this section.\n(E)\tHeight Modifications: A development which exceeds the permitted height requirements of Section 9-7-5, \"Building Height,\" or 9-7-6, \"Building Height, Conditional,\" B.R.C. 1981, or of Paragraph 9-10-3(b)(2), \"Maximum Height,\" B.R.C. 1981, to the extent permitted by that paragraph for existing buildings on nonstandard lots, is required to complete a site review and is not subject to the minimum threshold requirements. No standard other than height may be modified under the site review unless the project is also eligible for site review. A development that exceeds the permitted height requirements of Section 9-7-5 or 9-7-6, B.R.C. 1981, must meet any one of the following circumstances in addition to the site review criteria:\n(i)\tThe height modification is to allow a roof that has a pitch of 2:12 or greater in a building with three or fewer stories and the proposed height does not exceed the maximum height permitted in the zoning district by more than ten feet.\n(ii)\tThe building is in the industrial general, industrial service, or industrial manufacturing zoning district and has two or fewer stories and the building's height is necessary for a manufacturing, testing, or other industrial process or equipment.\n(iii)\tThe height modification is to allow up to the greater of two stories or the maximum number of stories permitted in Section 9-7-1, B.R.C. 1981, in a building and the height modification is necessary because of the topography of the site.\n(iv)\tThe height modification is to allow up to the greater of two stories or the maximum number of stories permitted but no more than five feet above the maximum building height under Section 9-7-5(a) or 9-7-6, B.R.C. 1981, in a building where the height modification is necessary because the building has to be elevated to meet the required flood protection elevation.\n(v)\tAt least forty percent of the dwelling units in the building meet the requirements for permanently affordable units in Chapter 9-13, \"Inclusionary Housing,\" B.R.C. 1981;

In applying this, the approving authority shall consistently interpret and apply this criterion and consider whether a particular goal or policy is intended to be applied to individual development projects or is to guide city policy decisions, such as regulatory actions. The BVCP does not prioritize goals and policies, and no project must satisfy one particular goal or policy or all of them.\n(B)\tSubcommunity and Area Plans or Design Guidelines: If the project is subject to an adopted subcommunity or area plan or adopted design guidelines, the project is generally consistent with the applicable plan and guidelines.\n(C)\tReducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Any new commercial building greater than 30,000 square feet in floor area and any 30,000 square feet or greater addition to a commercial building shall either have a net site energy usage index (EUI) of zero or is designed to achieve a net site EUI that is 10 percent lower than required under the City of Boulder Energy Conservation Code. It shall be a condition of approval that the applicant demonstrate compliance with this criterion at time of building permit. For the purpose of this requirement, \"commercial building\" shall have the meaning defined in the City of Boulder Energy Conservation Code.\n(D)\tUrban Edge Design: If the project is located within the urbanizing areas along the boundaries between Area I and Area II or III of the BVCP, the building and site design provide for a well-defined urban edge, and, if, in addition, the project is located on a major street shown in Appendix A of this title, the buildings and site design establish a sense of entry and arrival to the city by creating a defined urban edge through site and building design elements visible upon entry to the city.\n(E)\tHistoric or Cultural Resources: If present, the project protects significant historic and cultural resources. The approving authority may require application and good faith pursuit of local landmark designation.\n(F)\tHousing Diversity and Bedroom Unit Types: Except in the RR, RE and RL-1 zoning districts, projects that are more than 50 percent residential by measure of floor area, not counting enclosed parking areas, meet the following housing and bedroom unit type requirements in Subparagraph (i) through (vi). For the purposes of this subparagraph, qualifying housing type shall mean duplexes, attached dwelling units, townhouses, live-work units, or efficiency living units, and bedroom type shall mean studios or units with different numbers of bedrooms such as one-bedroom units and two-bedroom units.\n(i)\tProjects five acres or less shall include at least one qualifying housing type. In projects with efficiency living units, at least one additional qualifying housing type shall be provided consistent with the requirements of this paragraph;\n(ii)\tProjects greater than five acres shall include at least two qualifying housing types;\n(iii)\tProjects ten acres or more shall include at least three qualifying housing types;\n(iv)\tProjects greater than five acres shall include at least five dwelling units of each required qualifying housing type;\n(v)\tProjects with more than 20 attached dwelling units shall include at least two different bedroom types; and\n(vi)\tIf a project does not meet the requirements of Subsections (i) through (v) above, the applicant shall demonstrate that the project fulfills another at least equivalent community need related to housing policies identified in the BVCP.\n(G)\tEnvironmental Preservation:\n(i)\tThe project provides for the preservation of or mitigation of adverse impacts to natural features, including, without limitation, healthy long-lived trees, significant plant communities, ground and surface water, wetlands, riparian areas, drainage areas, and species on the federal Endangered Species List and \"Species of Special Concern in Boulder County\" designated by Boulder County and their habitat.\n(ii)\tWhere excavation occurs, the location and design of buildings conforms to the natural contours of the land with tiered floor plates, and the site design avoids over-engineered tabling of land. Slopes greater than 50 percent should be avoided and, to the extent practicable, any such areas shall be stabilized with vegetation.\n(2)\tSite Design Criteria: The project creates safe, convenient, and efficient connections for all modes of travel, promotes safe pedestrian, bicycle, and other modes of alternative travel with the goal of lowering motor vehicle miles traveled. Usable open space is arranged to be accessible; designed to be functional, encourage use, and enhance the attractiveness of the project; and meets the needs of the anticipated residents, occupants, tenants, and visitors to the project. Landscaping aesthetically enhances the project, minimizes use of water, is sustainable, and improves the quality of the environment. Operational elements are screened to mitigate negative visual impacts. In determining whether this is met, the approving agency will consider the following factors:\n(A)\tAccess, Transportation, and Mobility:\n(i)\tThe project enables or provides vehicular and pedestrian connectivity between sites consistent with adopted connections plans relative to the transportation needs and impacts of the project, including but not limited to construction of new streets, bike lanes, on-street parking, sidewalks, multi-use paths, transit stops, streetscape planting strips, and dedication of public right-of-way or public access easements, as applicable considering the scope of the project. Where no adopted connections plan applies, the applicant shall, in good faith, and in coordination with the city manager, attempt to coordinate with adjacent property owners to establish, where practicable, reasonable and useful pedestrian connections or vehicular circulation connections, such as between parking lots on abutting properties, considering existing connections, infrastructure, and topography.\n(ii)\tAlternatives to the automobile are promoted by incorporating site design techniques, land use patterns, and infrastructure that support and encourage walking, biking, and other alternatives to the single-occupant vehicle.\n(iii)\tA transportation demand management (TDM) plan will be complied with including methods that result in a significant shift away from single-occupant vehicle use to alternate modes.\n(iv)\tStreets, bikeways, pedestrian ways, trails, open space, buildings, and parking areas are designed and located to optimize safety of all modes and provide connectivity and functional permeability through the site.\n(v)\tThe design of vehicular circulation and parking areas make efficient use of the land and minimize the amount of pavement.\n(vi)\tWhere practicable and needed in the area and subject to coordination with the city manager, the project provides curbside parking or loading or both consistent with city policies on curbside management.\n(B)\tOpen Space:\n(i)\tUseable open space is arranged to be accessible and designed to encourage use by incorporating quality landscaping, a mixture of sun and shade, hardscape areas and green spaces for gathering.\n(ii)\tThe open space will meet the needs of the anticipated residents, occupants, tenants, and visitors of the property. In mixed-use projects, the open space provides for a balance of private and common areas for the residential uses and includes common open space that is available for use by residents of the residential uses and their visitors and by tenants, occupants, customers, and visitors of the non-residential uses.\n(iii)\tIf the project includes more than 50 dwelling units, including the addition of units that causes a project to exceed this threshold, and is more than one mile walking distance to a public park, at least 30 percent of the required outdoor open space is designed for active recreational purposes.\n(iv)\tOn-site open space is linked to adjacent public spaces, multi-use paths, city parks, or public open space if consistent with Department of Open Space and Mountain Parks or Department of Parks and Recreation plans and planning for the area, as applicable.\n(C)\tLandscaping and Screening:\n(i)\tThe project exceeds the minimum landscaping requirements of Section 9-9-12, \"Landscaping and Screening Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, by at least fifteen percent in terms of planting quantities, includes a commensurate area to accommodate the additional plantings, and, where practical, preserves healthy long-lived trees.\n(ii)\tThe landscaping design includes a variety of plants providing a variety of colors and contrasts in terms of texture and seasonality and high-quality hard surface materials, such as stone, flagstone, porous pavers, and decorative concrete.\n(iii)\tThe landscaping design conserves water through use of native and adaptive plants, reduction of exotic plant materials, and landscaping within stormwater detention facilities to create bioswales or rain gardens, or other similar design strategies.\n(iv)\tOperational elements, such as electrical transformers, trash storage and recycling areas, parking, and vehicular circulation, are screened from the public realm through design elements, such as landscaping, fencing, or placement of structures, to mitigate negative visual impacts.\n(3)\tBuilding Siting and Design Criteria: Building siting and design are consistent with the character established in any adopted plans or guidelines applicable to the site or, if none apply, are compatible with the character of the area or improves upon that character, consistent with the intent specified in this paragraph. Buildings are positioned and oriented towards the public realm to promote a safe and vibrant pedestrian experience including welcoming, well-defined entries and facades. Building exteriors are designed with a long-lasting appearance and high-quality materials. Building design is simple and to a human scale, it creates visual interest and a vibrant pedestrian experience. Building roof design contributes to a city skyline that has a variety of roof forms and heights. In determining whether this is met, the approving agency will consider the following factors:\n(A)\tBuilding Siting and Public Realm Interface:\n(i)\tNew buildings and, to the extent practicable, additions to existing buildings are positioned towards the street, respecting the existing conditions or the context anticipated by adopted plans or guidelines. In urban contexts, buildings are positioned close to the property line and sidewalk along a street; whereas, in lower intensity contexts, a greater landscaped setback may be provided to match the surrounding context.\n(ii)\tWherever practical considering the scope of the project, parking areas are located behind buildings or set back further from the streetscape than the building façade.\n(iii)\tAlong the public realm, building entries are emphasized by windows and architectural features that include one or more of the following: increased level of detail, protruding or recessed elements, columns, pilasters, protruding bays, reveals, fins, ribs, balconies, cornices, eaves, increased window glazing, or changes in building materials or color.\n(iv)\tDefined entries connect the building to the public realm. Unless inconsistent with the context and building's use, along the public realm, one defined entry is provided every 50 feet. Buildings designed for residential or industrial uses may have fewer defined entries.\n(v)\tIf the project is adjacent to a zoning district of lower intensity in terms of allowable use, density, massing, or scale, the project is designed with an appropriate transition to the adjacent properties considering adopted subcommunity and area plans or design guidelines applicable to the site, and, if none apply, the existing development pattern. Appropriate transitions may be created through design elements such as building siting and design or open space siting and design.\n(vi)\tThe building's siting and relationship to the public realm is consistent with the character established in any adopted plans or guidelines applicable to the site or, if none apply, is compatible with the character of the area or improves upon that character, consistent with the intent of Paragraph (3), Building Design Criteria.\n(B)\tBuilding Design:\n(i)\tLarger floor plate buildings and projects with multiple buildings have a variety of forms and heights.\n(ii)\tTo the extent practical considering their function, mechanical appurtenances are located within or concealed by the building. If they cannot be located within or concealed by the building, their visibility from the public realm and adjacent properties is minimized.\n(iii)\tOn each floor of the building, windows create visual interest, transparency, and a sense of connection to the public realm. In urban, pedestrian main street-built environments, it is a best practice to design at least 60 percent of each ground floor façade facing the street as window area. Otherwise, it is a best practice to design at least 20 percent of the wall on each floor of a building as window area. Blank walls along the most visible portions of the building are avoided.\n(iv)\tSimple detailing is incorporated into the façades to create visual interest, without making the façade overly complicated. This detailing may include cornices, belt courses, reveals, alternating brick or stone patterns, expression line offsets, window lintels and sills, and offsets in window glass from surrounding materials.\n(v)\tBalconies on buildings with attached dwelling units are integrated into the form of the building in that exterior walls partially enclose the balcony. Balcony platform undersides are finished.\n(vi)\tThe building's design, including but not limited to use of materials, color, roof forms, and style, is consistent with the character established in any adopted plans or guidelines applicable to the site or, if none apply, is compatible with the character of the area or improves upon that character, consistent with the intent of paragraph (3), Building Design Criteria.\n(C)\tBuilding Materials:\n(i)\tBuilding facades are composed of high-quality, durable, human-scaled materials. High-quality materials include brick, stone, polished concrete masonry units, wood, architectural high pressure laminate panels, cementitious or composite siding, architectural metal panels, or any combination of these materials. Split-faced concrete masonry units, stucco, vinyl siding, EIFS, and unfinished or untreated wood are not considered durable, high-quality materials, but may be used on a limited basis and not on facades facing the public realm. High quality materials are focused on the ground floor facades on all sides of a building and on all floors of facades facing the public realm, and, overall, comprise the vast majority of all building facades.\n(ii)\tMonolithic roofing membranes, like Thermoplastic Polyolefin, are not used on roof surfaces that are visible from the street level.\n(iii)\tThe number of building material types is limited, and the building materials are applied to complement the building form and function. The organization of the building materials logically expresses primary building features, such as the spatial layout, building entries, private and common spaces, anchor corners, stairwells, and elevators.\n(iv)\tBuilding cladding materials turn convex corners and continue to the inset wall. This criterion does not apply to changes that occur at an interior corner nor to detailing elements, such as cornices, belt courses, reveals, offsets in expression lines, lintels, and windowsills. Building cladding materials do not change in-plane unless there is at least a 12-inch wall offset.\n(v)\tAny newly constructed building that includes residential units and is located within 200 feet of a railroad, freeway, or expressway is designed to achieve an interior day-night average noise level of no more than forty-five decibels. Noise shall be measured in a manner that is consistent with the federal Housing and Urban Development's standards in Sections 24 CFR §§ 51.100 to 51.106 for the \"measure of external noise environments,\" or similar standard adopted by the city manager in the event that such rule is repealed. The applicant shall provide written certification prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy that the sound abatement and attenuation measures were incorporated in the construction and site design as recommended by a professional engineer.\n(4)\tAdditional Criteria for Buildings Requiring Height Modification or Exceeding the Maximum Floor Area Ratio: Any building exceeding the by-right or conditional zoning district height as permitted by Section 9-2-14(b)(1)(E), B.R.C. 1981, and any building exceeding the by-right floor area limits as permitted by Section 9-2-14(h)(6)(B), B.R.C. 1981, shall meet the following requirements:\n(A)\tBuilding Form and Massing: The building's form and massing are consistent with the character established in any adopted plans or guidelines applicable to the site or, if none apply, are compatible with the character of the area or improves upon that character, consistent with the intent of paragraph (3), Building Design Criteria. The building's form, massing and length are designed to a human scale and to create visual permeability into and through sites. In determining whether this is met, the approving authority will consider the following factors:\n(i)\tThe building does not exceed 200 feet in length along any public right-of-way.\n(ii)\tAll building facades exceeding 120 feet in length along a public street, excluding alleys, are designed to appear as at least two distinct buildings.

This open space will meet the needs of anticipated residents, occupants, tenants, and visitors of the property or will accommodate public gatherings, and may include, without limitation, recreational or cultural amenities, intimate spaces that foster social interaction, street furniture, landscaping, gardens, sculptures, and hard surface treatments: maximum twenty-five percent reduction.\n(B)\tLand Use Intensity Modifications with Height Bonus: In the BMS, BR-1, IMS, IS, MU-1, and MU-2 zoning districts if associated with a request for a height bonus, the floor area of a building may be increased above the maximum allowed in Chapter 9-8, \"Intensity Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, as follows, provided the building meets the requirements for a height bonus under Subparagraph 9-2-14(h)(6)(C), B.R.C. 1981:\n(i)\tIn the BMS zoning district outside a general improvement district providing off-street parking, and in the IMS, IS, MU-1, and MU-2 zoning districts, the base floor area ratio (FAR) in Table 8-2, Section 9-8-2, \"Floor Area Ratio Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981, may be increased by up to 0.5 FAR.\n(ii)\tIn the BR-1 zoning district, the maximum allowable floor area ratio (FAR) may be increased up to a 3.0 FAR.\n(C)\tAdditional Criteria for a Height Bonus and Land Use Intensity Modifications: A building proposed with a fourth or fifth story or addition thereto that exceeds the permitted height requirements of Section 9-7-5, \"Building Height,\" or 9-7-6, \"Building Height, Conditional,\" B.R.C. 1981, together with any additional floor area or residential density approved under Subparagraph (h)(6)(B), may be approved if it meets the requirements of this Subparagraph (h)(6)(C). For purposes of this Subparagraph(h)(6)(C), bonus floor area shall mean floor area that is on a fourth or fifth story and is partially or fully above the permitted height and any floor area that is the result of an increase in density or floor area described in Subparagraph (h)(6)(B). The approving authority may approve a height up to fifty-five feet if one of the following criteria is met:\n(i)\tResidential Developments: If the development is residential, it will exceed the requirements of Subparagraph 9-13-3(a)(1)(A), B.R.C. 1981, as follows:\na.\tFor bonus units, the inclusionary housing requirement under Chapter 9-13, \"Inclusionary Housing,\" B.R.C. 1981, shall be increased by eleven percent. The resulting inclusionary requirement may be satisfied by any option allowed in Chapter 9-13 to meet inclusionary housing requirements. For example, if Chapter 9-13 requires twenty-five percent of units to be permanently affordable, for bonus units that requirement is increased by eleven percent so that at least thirty-six percent of the total number of bonus units must be permanently affordable units.\nb.\tFor purposes of this Subparagraph (i), bonus units shall mean a number of units that is determined as follows: A percentage of all the units in the building that equals in number the percentage of bonus floor area in the building. For example, if twenty percent of the building's floor area is bonus floor area and the building has one hundred units, twenty percent of those one hundred units are bonus units, resulting in twenty bonus units.\nc.\tThe city manager shall review the development's compliance with this increased inclusionary housing requirement pursuant to the standards and review procedures of Chapter 9-13, \"Inclusionary Housing,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(ii)\tNon-Residential Developments: For non-residential developments, the applicant shall pay the affordable housing portion of the capital facility impact fee in Section 4-20-62, B.R.C. 1981, at a rate of 1.43 above the base requirement for the bonus floor area. In a building with several types of non-residential uses, the bonus floor area of each type identified under Section 4-20-62, B.R.C. 1981, shall be a percentage of the bonus floor area that equals in number the percentage of the total floor area in the building of such use type. For nonresidential uses with a fee that is calculated per room or bed under Section 4-20-62, B.R.C. 1981, the increased rate for the affordable housing portion of the fee shall apply to bonus rooms or bonus beds as applicable under that section; the number of bonus rooms or bonus beds shall be determined consistent with the methodology for bonus units in Subparagraph (i)b. above.\n(iii)\tMixed Use: If the development is a residential mixed-use development, the requirements of Subsections (i) and (ii) above shall apply to the bonus floor area according to the percentage of the total building floor area of each use.\n(iv)\tAlternative Community Benefit: Pursuant to the standard in this Subparagraph (iv), the approving authority may approve an alternative method of compliance to provide additional benefits to the community and qualify for a height bonus together with any additional floor area or density that may be approved under Subparagraph (h)(6)(B). The approving authority will approve the alternative method of compliance if the applicant proposes the alternative method of compliance and demonstrates that the proposed method:\na.\tWill improve the facilities or services delivered by the city, including without limitation any police, fire, human services, parks and recreation, or other municipal facility, land or service, or will provide an arts, cultural, human services, housing, environmental or other benefit that is a community benefit objective in the BVCP, and\nb.\tIs of a value that is equivalent to or greater than the benefits required by this Subparagraph (h)(6)(C).\n(i)\tPlanning Board Call-Up: The planning board may call-up any final site review decision by the city manager pursuant to Section 9-4-4, \"Appeals, Call-Ups and Public Hearings,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(j)\tSubdivisions: An approved site plan may be subdivided under Chapter 9-12, \"Subdivision,\" B.R.C. 1981.

Therefore, the city council shall grant a rezoning application only if the proposed rezoning is consistent with the policies and goals of the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan, and, for an application not incidental to a general revision of the zoning map, meets one of the following criteria:\n(1)\tThe applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed rezoning is necessary to come into compliance with the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan map;\n(2)\tThe existing zoning of the land was the result of a clerical error;\n(3)\tThe existing zoning of the land was based on a mistake of fact;\n(4)\tThe existing zoning of the land failed to take into account the constraints on development created by the natural characteristics of the land, including, but not limited to, steep slopes, floodplain, unstable soils and inadequate drainage;\n(5)\tThe land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to such a degree that it is in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or to recognize the changed character of the area; or\n(6)\tThe proposed rezoning is necessary in order to provide land for a community need that was not anticipated at the time of adoption of the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan.\n(f)\tAdditional Criteria for the MU-4, RH-3, RH-6 and RH-7 zoning districts. In the MU-4, RH-3, RH-6 and RH-7 zoning districts, for an application not incidental to a general revision of the zoning map, the city council shall also find that the rezoning meets the following criteria, in addition to Subsection (e) above:\n(1)\tTransportation. The land proposed for rezoning is:\n(A)\tSubject to a right-of-way plan for the immediate area;\n(B)\tThe right-of-way plan is capable of being implemented to the extent necessary to serve the property and to connect to the arterial street network through collector and local streets, alleys, multi-use paths and sidewalks concurrent with redevelopment; and\n(C)\tThe public infrastructure can be paid for by way of redevelopment under the provisions of Section 9-9-8, \"Reservations, Dedication and Improvement of Rights-of-Way,\" B.R.C. 1981, without contribution of funds by the city, or that there is a plan for financing and construction that has been approved by city council through the capital improvement program and the city council anticipates appropriating such funds within two years of the rezoning.\n(2)\tWater, Wastewater and Stormwater Management and Flood Control. The city council shall determine whether there are adequate public facilities available for the rezoning area. The city council shall determine whether there are adequate water, wastewater and stormwater management and flood control facilities by considering the following:\n(A)\tWhether the infrastructure meets the requirements of the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards, adopted city master plans, the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan, subcommunity plans and area plans.\n(B)\tWhether the land proposed to be rezoned has adequate water, wastewater and stormwater management and flood control public facilities that are:\n(i)\tIn place at the time of the rezoning request;\n(ii)\tUnder construction and will be available at the time that the impacts of the proposed development will occur; or\n(iii)\tGuaranteed by an enforceable development agreement ensuring that the public facilities will be in place at the time that the impacts of the proposed development will occur.\n(C)\tWhether the property owner has, or will in the future, paid its fair share of the infrastructure needs of the surrounding area, as described in city master plans, subcommunity plans or area plans.\n(3)\tTransportation Demand Management Services. In the MU-4, RH-6 and RH-7 zoning districts, the property subject to the rezoning is located within an area that has parking and transportation related service provided by a general improvement district or an equivalent organization or otherwise meets the trip generation requirements of Section 9-9-22, \"Trip Generation Requirements for the MU-4, RH-6 and RH-7 Zoning Districts,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(g)\tSolar Access Areas: A request for rezoning may seek to amend a solar access area, as defined in Subsection 9-9-17(c), B.R.C. 1981, if all applicable requirements of Subsection 9-9-17(e), B.R.C. 1981, are met.\nOrdinance Nos. 7655 (2009); 8544 (2022); 8668 (2024); 8669 (2025)",
