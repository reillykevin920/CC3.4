    "heading": "Requirements Applicable to All Building Types.",
    "verbatim": "(a)\tPurpose. The purpose of the building type requirements is to establish standards for building design, building form, siting of buildings, and specific uses based on the building type that may be utilized on a property pursuant to the applicable regulating plan or as otherwise authorized.\n(b)\tBuilding Types Requirements. No person shall develop, use, or occupy any building or other property located within the area designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" B.R.C. 1981, except in conformance with the building type standards of sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21 of this chapter unless modified through an exception under Subsection 9-2-16(i), B.R.C. 1981. This following generally describes the building types:\n(1)\tMain Street Storefront Description. The main street storefront building type is a highly pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use building. Ground story storefront is required along all Type A streets with only personal service, retail, dining, and entertainment uses to provide activity. Upper story uses are flexible. Parking is in the rear of the lot or located off-site. Refer to Section 9-14-16, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(2)\tCommercial Storefront Description. The commercial storefront building type permits single use buildings and more parking locations, but still addresses pedestrian orientation with buildings built up to the sidewalk and storefront glass requirements. This building type allows a broader variety of commercial, retail, and industrial uses on the ground story, including vehicle-related uses. Refer to Section 9-14-17, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(3)\tGeneral Building Description. The general building type is a basic building that serves as urban fabric, built along the sidewalk connecting the more commercial spaces with open spaces. This building can accommodate a wide range of uses. It differs from the storefront by its lower requirement for ground story glass and allowance for an above-sidewalk level ground story elevation. Refer to Section 9-14-18, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(4)\tRow Building Description. The row building type is similar to the general building but is smaller in scale. The ground story is required to be divided into different units, each with separate entrances. Townhouses, rowhouses, live-work units, incubator space, or small width industrial or craftsman spaces fit well into this building type. Refer to Section 9-14-19, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(5)\tWorkshop Building Description. The workshop building type is similar to the general building but allows the service base with garage door access more widely. The ground story is also typically taller to allow for production uses. Refer to Section 9-14-20, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(6)\tCivic Building Description. The civic building type is the most flexible building, meant to allow for more iconic designs within the urban fabric of the area. This building type is limited to specific public and institutional uses, such as governmental facilities, religious assemblies, schools, colleges, and universities, as well as parks and recreation uses, museums, and live theaters. Refer to Section 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, for requirements.\n(c)\tUses in Building Types. All uses of a property shall meet the requirements of Chapter 9-6, \"Use Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981. Where use regulations are imposed by this chapter based on the building type, the use of the property shall also be consistent with those standards.\n(d)\tGeneral Building Design Requirements. All buildings shall comply with the building design requirements of sections 9-14-22 through 9-14-33 of this chapter.\n(e)\tMultiple Principal Structures. Multiple structures may be constructed on a lot or parcel. All structures shall meet the applicable building type requirements, including the frontage setback requirements.\n(f)\tBuild to the Corner. On corners, a building or structure shall be located at the intersection of the two frontage setbacks as shown in Figure 14-24. The standards of Subparagraph 9-14-10(a)(3)(B), \"Sight Triangle Area,\" B.R.C. 1981, must also be met.\nFigure 14-24. Build-to Corner and Frontage Setbacks\n(g)\tStreetwall Courtyards. Where minimum streetwall is required and streetwall variation is not required, courtyards meeting the requirements of Paragraph 9-14-14(h)(1), B.R.C. 1981, are allowed provided they do not exceed thirty-five percent of the streetwall. The courtyard counts towards the required minimum streetwall percentage.\n(h)\tRequired Streetwall Variation. Where streetwall variation is required, a courtyard or streetscape plaza meeting the following requirements shall be provided for streetwall increment required per the building type:\n(1)\tCourtyard. Courtyards shall meet the following requirements:\n(A)\tThe courtyard is at least thirty feet in width and thirty feet in depth.\n(B)\tThe courtyard abuts the frontage setback.\n(C)\tThere is no motor vehicle parking in the courtyard.\n(D)\tThe courtyard facades are treated with the frontage type of the adjacent street frontage per facade requirements for the building type and building design requirements in Sections 9-14-27 through 9-14-33, B.R.C. 1981.\n(E)\tThe courtyard design includes the following:\n(i)\tNo more than sixty-five percent of the area is paved and the hardscape includes special paving materials and patterns.\n(ii)\tLandscape beds and trees consistent with Subsection 9-14-11(b), \"Street Yard Design,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(iii)\tSeating and amenities consistent with Subsection 9-14-11(b), \"Street Yard Design,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(2)\tStreetscape Plaza. Streetscape plazas shall meet the following requirements:\n(A)\tThe streetscape plaza is located within the maximum setback.\n(B)\tAt least thirty-five percent of the streetwall fronts one or more streetwall plazas extending from the right-of-way to the maximum setback.\n(C)\tThe minimum width of each streetscape plaza along the frontage is 20 feet.\n(D)\tThe streetscape plaza is designed to integrate with the street yard and streetscape design and includes the following:\n(i)\tHardscape in the plaza includes special paving materials and patterns.\n(ii)\tLandscape beds and trees are provided consistent with the requirements of Subsection 9-14-11(b), \"Street Yard Design,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(iii)\tSeating and amenities are provided consistent with the requirements of Subsection 9-14-11(b), \"Street Yard Design,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(i)\tTerminated Vistas. Street terminates or curves on or adjacent to a property as designated on the regulating plan, the site or building design shall include a feature to terminate the view from the street or path. The project shall meet the following standards:\n(1)\tOpen Space. If the property where the vista is required to be terminated is open space, one of the outdoor space types established in Section 9-14-12, \"Outdoor Space Requirements,\" B.R.C. 1981, shall be utilized, and a vertical feature shall terminate the view. Acceptable vertical features include, but are not limited to, a stand or grid of at least three large maturing trees, listed in the approved tree list published annually by the city manager, a sculpture, a gazebo, or a fountain.\n(2)\tBuilding. If the property where the vista is required to be terminated is not utilized as open space, the facade of a building shall terminate the view. At the termination point designated on the regulating plan, a minimum of sixty feet of the building facade shall meet the standards applicable to a Type A frontage, whether or not fronting on a Type A street, with the exception of the entrance requirements. The building shall include a feature that terminates the view, such as, a tower, cupola, bay, courtyard, or a streetscape plaza consistent with the streetwall variation requirements in Section 9-14-14(h), B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tParking or Other Facades. A parking structure, surface parking lot, or side or rear facade shall not terminate a vista.\n(j)\tTrash and Recycling Areas. Unless otherwise allowed by the building type, all trash, recycling, and other waste areas shall be located inside the building or in the parking yard consistent with the following requirements:\n(1)\tInterior of the Building. Refuse, recycling, and other waste areas located inside the building shall meet the following requirements:\n(A)\tAccess doors to the area shall be located on the rear or interior side facade.\n(B)\tIf no rear or interior side facade exists, access doors may be located off a Type B or C street facade.\n(C)\tAccess doors or gates on a street facade shall have a minimum opacity of 80 percent.\n(D)\tAccess gates shall be set back a minimum of five feet from any street facade.\n(2)\tOther Locations. When no parking yard exists, the parking or rear yard is less than ten feet in depth, and an interior building location is not available, trash, recycling, and other waste areas may be located in the rear yard, interior side yard, or in a Type B or C street yard.\n(k)\tGarage Entrances. Garage doors shall be located on a Type B frontage, Type C frontage, rear or interior yard, or along an interior side facade, except that on the service base garage doors may also be located consistent with the standards in Section 9-14-24, \"Service Base,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(1)\tGarage doors on Type B frontages shall be set back from the majority of the frontage facade a minimum of three feet.\n(2)\tGarage doors on Type B frontages shall meet minimum facade transparency requirements unless art is incorporated into the door.\n(l)\tLoading Locations. All on-site loading areas shall be located in the rear or interior yard for all building types, except that on the service base on-site loading areas may also be located consistent with the standards in Section 9-14-24, B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance Nos. 8669 (2025); 8697 (2025)",

    "verbatim": "The standards outlined in the tables in Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, applicable to each building type, shall be measured and calculated consistent with the following standards:\n(a)\tMinimum Type A Frontage Streetwall Coverage. The minimum percentage of building facade along the Type A frontage of a lot is measured as follows:\n(1)\tMeasurement. The minimum Type A frontage streetwall shall, at a minimum, equal the width of the principal structures, as measured within the minimum and maximum setback along the frontage, divided by the length of the frontage parallel to the property line following the street minus setbacks along perpendicular property lines. Refer to Figure 14-51. Minimum Type A Frontage Streetwall.\n(2)\tCourtyards. For some building types, courtyards located along the facade in the frontage setback count towards the minimum coverage. Refer to building type requirements of Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tOutdoor Space Type. Open spaces meeting the requirements of one of the outdoor space types established in this chapter are exempt from the minimum Type A frontage streetwall requirement.\nFigure 14-51. Minimum Type A Frontage Streetwall\n(b)\tFrontage Setback. The minimum to maximum frontage setback shall be calculated and measured as follows. Refer to Figure 14-52. Frontage Setbacks.\n(1)\tMeasurement. If the frontage is a Type A, B, or C frontage along a transportation improvement or waterway, the minimum and maximum frontage setbacks are measured from the outside edge of an easement for the transportation improvement or waterway, or, if no easement exists, from the parcel or lot line abutting the transportation improvement or waterway, as applicable. If the frontage is along a required outdoor space, the minimum and maximum frontage setbacks are measured from the outside edge of an easement for the outdoor space, or, if no easement exists, from the parcel or lot line abutting to the outdoor space, or if not within a separate parcel or lot, from the outer edge of the outdoor space as delineated on the site plan.\n(2)\tHeight. All building facades located within the frontage setback shall meet the minimum building height of the building.\n(3)\tEncroachments. Awnings, architectural projections, balconies, and building mounted signage may extend beyond the frontage setback into any yard area but shall not extend into the street right-of-way or public easement unless approved with a revocable permit or lease, as applicable.\nFigure 14-52. Frontage Setbacks\n(c)\tLimited Side Yard Parking. Where allowed by building type, parking may be located in the interior side yard, consistent with the following requirements:\n(1)\tThe limited side yard parking lot is located fully in an interior side yard.\n(2)\tThe limited side yard parking is configured as one double- or one single-loaded aisle of parking and the centerline of the aisle is located perpendicular to the street.\n(3)\tThe limited side yard parking is not located on corners in any street yard.\n(4)\tNo more than one limited side yard parking lot per building is located along any street frontage.\n(5)\tThe limited side yard parking lots is not located next to another limited side yard parking lot.\n(d)\tMaximum Impervious and Additional Semi-Pervious Coverage. Impervious and additional semi-pervious coverage shall be calculated and measured as follows. Refer to Figure 14-53. Impervious and Semi-Pervious Coverage.\n(1)\tMaximum Impervious Coverage. The maximum impervious coverage is the maximum percentage of a lot permitted to be covered by structures, pavement, and other impervious surfaces.\n(2)\tAdditional Semi-Pervious Coverage. In addition to the allowable impervious coverage on a site, a maximum amount of additional semi-pervious coverage is permitted.\nFigure 14-53. Impervious and Semi-Pervious Coverage\n(e)\tOverall Minimum and Maximum Height. (Refer to Figure 14-54. Measuring Stories with Floor-to-Floor Height.)\n(1)\tMinimum Overall Height. Each building type requires a minimum number of stories. The building must meet the minimum required height along all Type A frontage facades and measured a minimum of thirty feet deep into the building.\n(2)\tMaximum Overall Height. Maximum heights are specified both in number of stories and overall dimension. This requirement applies to the entire building.\n(A)\tTowers. Where specifically allowed in the building type tables, Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, towers may exceed the overall maximum height of the building type per subsection (f) of Section 9-14-25, \"Cap Types,\" B.R.C. 1981. Towers shall not exceed the maximum height per section 84 of the charter of the City of Boulder.\n(B)\tCap Type. Where specified in subsection (f) of Section 9-14-25, \"Cap Types,\" B.R.C. 1981, certain cap types may allow additional height.\n(C)\tMaximum Heights per the City Charter. Under no circumstances may any building or structure exceed the height limitations established in section 84 of the charter of the City of Boulder.\n(D)\tHeight Measurement Standards. Height shall be measured consistent with height measurement standards of Section 9-7-5, \"Building Height,\" B.R.C. 1981, and the definition of \"height\" within Section 9-16-1, \"General Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(E)\tView Corridors. Height is subject to additional limitations where maximum heights are restricted pursuant to the regulating plan to preserve a view corridor. Refer to Sections 9-14-6, \"Regulating Plans,\" and 9-14-7, \"View Corridors,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tTwo Half Stories. If a building has both a half story within the roof and a half story that is partially above and partially below grade, the combined height of the two half stories shall be considered one full story.\n(f)\tMinimum and Maximum Height per Story. Each story is measured with a range of permitted floor-to-floor heights. Refer to Figure 14-54. Measuring Stories with Floor-to-Floor Height.\n(1)\tMeasurement. Story height shall be measured in feet between the floor of a story to the floor of the story above it. Minimum and maximum floor-to-floor heights are required to be met along facades for a minimum of eighty percent of each story.\n(2)\tSingle Story Buildings and Top Story Measurement. For single story buildings and the uppermost story of a multiple story building, the minimum floor-to-floor height shall be one foot less than that required per building type. The measurement shall be from the floor of the story to the ceiling.\n(3)\tMezzanines. Mezzanines may be included within the floor-to-floor height of any story. Mezzanines occupying more than thirty percent of the floor area below and extending above the story's allowable floor-to-floor height shall count as an additional story and shall meet transparency requirements in subsection (e)(5), below.\n(4)\tTaller Spaces. Spaces exceeding the allowable floor-to-floor heights of the building type are permitted on any facade. On Type A and B frontage facades, the taller space is limited to no more than 35% of the length of the façade or 35 feet, whichever is less. Taller spaces may not exceed the total height of the surrounding stories, and the façade meet the transparency requirements of the surrounding stories.\nFigure 14-54. Measuring Stories with Floor-to-Floor Height\n(g)\tMinimum Required Transparency. Per the requirements of each building type, a minimum amount of transparency is required on all stories of street, courtyard, and public way facades. The following applies to transparency requirements:\n(1)\tMeasurement. Minimum facade transparency is measured from floor-to-floor of each story separately, except for required minimum ground story transparency (refer to Paragraph 9-14-26(g)(4), B.R.C. 1981, below). Refer to Figure 14-55. Measuring Minimum Facade Transparency. Transparency requirements shall be met with windows or glass in doors meeting the standards for transparency as defined in Section 9-14-8, \"Definitions,\" B.R.C. 1981. The measurement may include the frame, mullions, and muntins, but shall not include trim or casing.\nFigure 14-55. Measuring Minimum Facade Transparency\n(2)\tBlank Wall Limitations. Refer to Figure 14-56. Measuring Blank Wall Limitations.\n(A)\tIntent. The intent of the blank wall limitations is to avoid long stretches of blank walls, distribute transparency within a story, and ensure that windows are located at the height of a person standing within the story.\n(B)\tWhere the building type standards impose blank wall limitations, the following applies:\n(i)\tNo rectangular area greater than thirty percent of the story's facade, as measured floor to floor, shall be without transparency. Refer to Figure 14-56. Measuring Blank Wall Limitations.\n(ii)\tNo horizontal segment of a story's facade greater than fifteen feet in width shall be without transparency. Refer to Figure 14-56. Measuring Blank Wall Limitations.\nFigure 14-56. Measuring Blank Wall Limitations\n(3)\tException. When the facade of any story is located less than six feet from another parallel building facade, no minimum transparency is required for that story.\n(4)\tMinimum Ground Story Transparency. When required by the building type tables of Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, ground story transparency shall be measured between two feet and either eight or ten feet, as specified per building type, from the average grade at the base of the facade. The minimum ground story transparency requirements supersede the minimum transparency required for the building type.\n(5)\tMezzanines. Mezzanines shall be treated as a separate story and include the required upper story transparency amounts.\n(6)\tTall Stories. Stories that are eighteen feet or taller in height shall include additional transparency consistent with the following standards. Refer to Figure 14-57. Transparency on Tall Stories.\n(A)\tSeparate Ground Story Transparency Required. When a separate minimum ground story transparency is required per the building types requirements of Sections 9-14-16 through 9-14-21, B.R.C. 1981, the facade design shall fulfill that requirement in addition to a minimum of twenty-five percent transparency for the remainder of the ground story.\n(B)\tNo Separate Ground Story Transparency Required. Except on a ground story facade to which a Type A frontage ground story facade transparency requirement applies, a tall story shall be treated as two separate stories, divided in half horizontally, with the minimum transparency per story applied to each half.\n(7)\tHalf Stories. All half stories located within the roof structure and within visible basements are required to meet the minimum required transparency.\nFigure 14-57. Transparency on Tall Stories\n(h)\tMinimum Number of Required Entrances. Entrances shall be provided consistent with the entrance location and number requirements established for the building type and consistent with Figure 14-58.

The intent of the requirements in Sections 9-14-27 through 9-14-33, B.R.C. 1981, is to implement the vision for the area as defined in adopted plans for the area, create a sense of place and community, elicit simple, honest, high quality, durable buildings of appropriate scale and massing that are visually interesting, aesthetically pleasing, create a sense of permanence, and are human scaled to enhance the pedestrian experience.\n(1)\tSimple. Simple means the building design is organized and easy-to-comprehend through the use of repetition, regularity, and a clear hierarchy.\n(2)\tHonest. Honest means the building is easily interpreted by the casual observer. Entrances, floors, and building use are apparent and the form of the building follows the function. The overall bulk and mass of the building clearly represents the structure, spatial layout, and materiality.\n(3)\tHuman-Scaled. Human-scaled means the buildings are scaled to proportions comfortable to people. Typically, human-scaled buildings have smaller building material units, architectural detailing to accentuate building elements, and a predictable rhythm to the facade pattern. This design approach is used particularly on the ground story where people walk adjacent to the building.\n(b)\tApplicability. The requirements of Sections 9-14-27 through 9-14-33, B.R.C. 1981, establish general building design requirements applicable to all buildings located on a property designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" regardless of the building type. No person shall use or develop land in such areas except in conformance with the requirements of Sections 9-14-27 through 9-14-33, B.R.C. 1981, unless an exception has been granted pursuant to Subsection 9-2-16(i), B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance No. 8669 (2025)",

In Boulder Junction I and Alpine-Balsam, architectural metal panel systems shall not be used to meet this standard.\n(4)\tCorners of Buildings. Where Type A, B, or C facades are located perpendicular to a rear, interior side, or rail corridor facade, the major materials on the Type A, B, or C facade shall be continued around the corner along the perpendicular facade for a minimum of thirty feet.\n(c)\tProhibited Materials. The materials listed in Table 14-11, \"Prohibited Materials,\" are prohibited on any building facade. See Figure 14-60. Examples of Prohibited Facade Materials.\n(d)\tMinor Materials. Minor materials may be installed on the remaining facade areas of the building not required to meet major material requirements. Minor materials are materials listed as allowed minor facade materials in Table 14-9, \"Allowed Minor Facade Materials,\" for the relevant form-based code area.\n(e)\tDetails and Accents. Detail and accent materials listed in Table 14-10 may be installed as a detail or accent on any facade. The approving authority may allow other details and accent materials that are similar in quality and durability to those listed in Table 14-10, \"Allowed Detail & Accent Materials.\"\n(f)\tSolar Panels. Where solar panels are mounted on any facade, any major or minor facade material may be used on that facade, provided the material is not visible through the panels.\nFigure 14-59. Acceptable Materials\nFigure 14-60. Unacceptable Major Materials\n(g)\tOther Materials with Approval. Materials that are not listed in this section for its proposed application as an allowed major material or allowed minor material may not be installed on any facade unless approved by the approving authority pursuant to this subsection (d).\n(1)\tThe approving authority may approve facade materials that are not listed in this section for its proposed application if the applicant demonstrates the material in its proposed application meets the intent of the facade material standards described in subsection (a) of this section.

False balconies consist of a rail and door, and any outdoor platform less than eighteen inches in depth. The requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) do not apply to false balconies.\nFigure 14-65. Examples of Balconies\n(d)\tShutters. If included in the design, shutters, whether functional or not, shall meet the following requirements:\n(1)\tSize. All shutters shall be sized for the windows, so that, if the shutters were to be closed, they would not be too small for complete coverage of the window.\n(2)\tMaterials. Shutters shall be wood, metal, fiber cement, composite wood, or high-pressure laminate (HPL). Vinyl shutters are prohibited. Other \"engineered\" materials may be approved provided that the applicant submits a sample and examples of high quality, local installations of the material, installed a minimum of five years earlier and showing no degradation or wear of the material.\n(e)\tPrincipal Entryway. See Figure 14-66. Examples of Defined Principal Entryway. Principal entrances to buildings or units, with the exception of ground story storefront systems, are subject to the following:\n(1)\tPrincipal entrances shall be clearly delineated through at least two of the following design features:\n(A)\tCap or Canopy. The entryway is covered by a cap or canopy differentiating it from the overall building cap.\n(B)\tPorch. The entryway is through a porch.\n(C)\tSidelights and Transom. Sidelights or transom windows are included around the entryway.\n(D)\tLighting Feature. The entrance is lit with a sculptural lighting feature or other unique lighting system visible during daylight.\n(E)\tSculpture or Mural. The entryway is defined by a special art feature, either a sculpture or mural.\n(F)\tExtended Articulation. The entryway is included in a separate bay of the building that extends up at least two stories.\n(2)\tOther Design. The approving authority may approve a design that does not meet the standards of this subsection if the authority finds that the design adds emphasis and draws attention to the entryway.\n(3)\tRight-of-Way. Doors shall not swing into city right-of-way or easement.\nFigure 14-66. Examples of Defined Principal Entryway\nOrdinance No. 8669 (2025)",

    "verbatim": "(a)\tIntent. Mechanical equipment and utility equipment can have a negative visual impact and detract from the quality of the design of a building. The purpose of the standards of this section is to ensure that the visual impact of mechanical and utility equipment is minimized.\n(b)\tMechanical Equipment in Building. Mechanical equipment shall be located within the building, unless the applicant demonstrates the equipment is necessary for the function of the building and locating the equipment within the building would conflict with the equipment's function or present a health and safety risk to the occupants of the building. If the mechanical equipment is necessary for the function of the building and locating it within the building would conflict with its function or present a health and safety risk to building occupants, the equipment may be located on the rooftop, on facades, or on horizontal surfaces consistent with the standards of this section.\n(c)\tRooftop Mechanical Equipment. In addition to the meeting the requirements of Section 9-7-7, \"Building Height, Appurtenances,\" B.R.C. 1981, any rooftop mechanical equipment, including without limitation vents, ventilators, skylights, and antennas, and excluding solar energy and wind energy conversion systems, shall meet the following standards:\n(1)\tRooftop mechanical equipment shall be located consistent with one of the following methods:\n(A)\tIncorporate equipment into the roof design consistent with the applicable standards of Section 9-14-25, \"Cap Types,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(B)\tSet the equipment back a minimum of twenty feet from any Type A or B frontage facade.\n(d)\tMechanical Equipment on Facades. Mechanical equipment shall not be located on a facade unless the applicant demonstrates that locating the equipment in a different location would conflict with the equipment's function. Any mechanical equipment on a facade, such as dryer vents, gas meters, and air conditioners, shall be located consistent with the following standards:\n(1)\tFacade. The mechanical equipment may be located on a non-Type A frontage facade. The equipment and appurtenances may be located on a Type A frontage facade only if the following requirements are met:\n(A)\tThe equipment is located on a surface perpendicular to any right-of-way;\n(B)\tThe equipment extends from the facade surface no more than three inches; and\n(C)\tThe equipment is screened from the sidewalk.\n(2)\tAlignment. Multiple pieces of mechanical equipment shall be organized on the facade in a regular pattern and aligned. Compliance with this standard shall be illustrated on the drawing elevations submitted as part of the application.\n(3)\tMaterial Coordination. To the extent practicable, facade-mounted mechanical equipment shall be located on a material that limits their visibility. For example, dark colored vents will be more visible on light colored stucco than a textured, darker surface such as brick.\n(4)\tScreening. Mechanical equipment shall be screened from view unless the approving authority finds that such screening conflicts with the function of the equipment. The form, material, and color of the screening shall meet the following criteria:\n(A)\tScreening, other than landscaping, is consistent with the building design, colors, and materials;\n(B)\tThe equipment is placed where it is least visible from adjacent streets;\n(C)\tThe height of any screen is the minimum appropriate to adequately screen the mechanical equipment; and\n(D)\tScreening does not increase the apparent height of the walls of the building.\n(5)\tNo encroachment. Mechanical equipment shall not extend into any public right-of-way or easement.\n(e)\tMechanical and Utility Equipment on Other Horizontal Surfaces. Mechanical equipment and utility equipment located on the ground, decks, or horizontal surfaces other than the roof, such as, but not limited to, electrical equipment and air conditioners, shall be located consistent with the following standards:\n(1)\tAll equipment may be located in the parking yard or a Type B Street yard.\n(2)\tEquipment may be located in a side yard provided the side yard does not contain or abut a paseo.\n(3)\tAll equipment shall be screened from view from any public way with landscaping, fencing, or walls consistent with the building design, colors, and materials.\n(4)\tThe reviewing authority may approve mechanical or utility equipment to located on a Type A street or on a paseo only if the following conditions are met:\n(A)\tThe applicant demonstrates that the equipment cannot be located in a parking yard, Type B Street yard, or in a side yard that does not contain a paseo.\n(B)\tThe equipment is fully screened with a wall that is consistent with the building design, colors, and materials and of a height that is the minimum to adequately screen the equipment and that does not prevent the facade from fulfilling any transparency requirements.\nOrdinance No. 8669 (2025)",
