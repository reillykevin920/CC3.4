Townhouse lots that do not meet the standards of paragraphs (B) or (C) above shall be used solely for townhouses.\n(E)\tLots and existing structures meet all applicable zoning requirements of this title and Section 9-9-17, \"Solar Access,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(F)\tLots with double frontage are avoided, except where necessary to provide separation from major arterials or incompatible land uses or because of the slope of the lot.\n(G)\tSide lot lines are substantially at right angles or radial to the centerline of streets, whenever feasible.\n(H)\tCorner lots are larger than other lots to accommodate setback requirements of Section 9-7-1, \"Schedule of Form and Bulk Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(I)\tResidential lots are shaped so as to accommodate a dwelling unit within the setbacks prescribed by the zoning district.\n(J)\tLots shall not be platted on land with a ten percent or greater slope, unstable land or land with inadequate drainage unless each platted lot has at least one thousand square feet of buildable area, with a minimum dimension of twenty-five feet. The city manager may approve the platting of such land upon finding that acceptable measures, submitted by a registered engineer qualified in the particular field, eliminate or control the problems of instability or inadequate drainage.\n(K)\tWhere a subdivision borders an airport, a railroad right-of-way, a freeway, a major street or any other major source of noise, the subdivision is designed to reduce noise in residential lots to a reasonable level and to retain limited access to such facilities by such measures as a parallel street, a landscaped buffer area or lots with increased setbacks.\n(L)\tEach lot contains at least one deciduous street tree of two-inch caliper in residential subdivisions, and each corner lot contains at least one tree for each street upon which the lot fronts, located so as not to interfere with sight distance at driveways and chosen from the list of acceptable trees established by the city manager, unless the subdivision agreement provides that the subdivider will obtain written commitments from subsequent purchasers to plant the required trees.\n(M)\tThe subdivider provides permanent survey monuments, range points and lot pins placed by a Colorado registered land surveyor.\n(N)\tWhere an irrigation ditch or channel, natural creek, stream or other drainage way crosses a subdivision, the subdivider provides an easement sufficient for drainage and maintenance.\n(O)\tLots are assigned street numbers by the city manager under the City's established house numbering system, and before final building inspection, the subdivider installs numbers clearly visible and made of durable material.\n(P)\tFor the purpose of ensuring the potential for utilization of solar energy in the City, the subdivider places streets, lots, open spaces and buildings so as to maximize the potential for the use of solar energy in accordance with the following solar siting criteria:\n(i)\tPlacement of Open Space and Streets: Open space areas are located wherever practical to protect buildings from shading by other buildings within the development or from buildings on adjacent properties. Topography and other natural features and constraints may justify deviations from this criterion.\n(ii)\tLot Layout and Building Siting: Lots are oriented and buildings sited in a way which maximizes the solar potential of each principal building. Lots are designed so that it would be easy to site a structure which is unshaded by other nearby structures and so as to allow for owner control of shading. Lots also are designed so that buildings can be sited so as to maximize the solar potential of adjacent properties by minimizing off-site shading.\n(iii)\tBuilding Form: The shapes of buildings are designed to maximize utilization of solar energy. Existing and proposed buildings shall meet the solar access protection and solar siting requirements of Section 9-9-17, \"Solar Access,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(iv)\tLandscaping: The shading impact of proposed landscaping on adjacent buildings is addressed by the applicant. When a landscape plan is required, the applicant shall indicate the plant type and whether the plant is coniferous or deciduous.\n(2)\tTransportation Standards for Streets, Alleys and Sidewalks: Streets, curb and gutters, sidewalks, alleys and the public rights-of-way therefor are provided in conformity with the standards in the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards, and meet the following conditions:\n(A)\tStreets are aligned to join with planned or existing streets.\n(B)\tStreets are designed to bear a relationship to the topography, minimizing grade, slope and fill.\n(C)\tThere are no dead-end streets without an adequate turnaround and appropriate barriers.\n(D)\tAccess to freeway, arterial, or collector street occurs only at intersections approved by the city manager, if the manager finds that the access provides efficient traffic movement and safety for drivers and pedestrians.\n(E)\tA street of only one-half width is not dedicated to or accepted by the city.\n(F)\tWhen the plat dedicates a street that ends on the plat or is on the perimeter of the plat, the subdivider conveys that last foot of the street on the terminal end or outside border of the plat to the city in fee simple, and it is designated by using an outlot.\n(G)\tStreets are provided as prescribed by the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan, adopted subcommunity or area plans, or the Transportation Master Plan.\n(H)\tAlleys are encouraged and should be provided. If they are provided, they are paved or otherwise appropriately surfaced with a material approved by the city manager for the specific application and location.\n(I)\tSidewalks are provided in all subdivisions, unless the city manager determines that no public need exists for sidewalks in a certain location.\n(J)\tSigns for street names (subject to approval of the city manager), directions, and hazards are provided.\n(K)\tTraffic control signs are provided, as required by the city manager for control of traffic.\n(L)\tPedestrian crosswalks are provided, as required by the city manager for traffic control and, at a minimum, between streets where the distance between intersecting streets exceeds one thousand feet.\n(M)\tBike paths or lanes are provided in conformity with the City of Boulder Comprehensive Plan for bicycle facilities and are dedicated to the city.\n(N)\tPrivate streets are not permitted.\n(3)\tStandards for Water and Wastewater Improvements: Water and wastewater utilities are provided in conformity with the construction and design standards in the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards, and meet the following conditions:\n(A)\tWater and sanitary sewer mains are provided as necessary to serve the subdivision.\n(B)\tEasements are provided for city utilities as prescribed by the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards.\n(C)\tEasements for utilities other than city utilities are provided as required by the applicable private utility.\n(D)\tNewly installed telephone, electric, and cable television lines and other similar utility service are placed underground. Existing utilities are also placed underground unless the subdivider demonstrates to the manager that the cost substantially outweighs the visual benefit from doing so. But transformers, switching boxes, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals, ducts, electric transmission and distribution feeder lines, communication long distance trunk and feeder lines, and other facilities necessarily appurtenant to such facilities and to underground utilities may be placed above ground within dedicated easements or public rights-of-way.\n(4)\tStandards for Flood Control and Storm Drainage: Flood control and storm drainage measures are provided as required by the city's master drainage plan and in conformity with the construction and design standards in the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards, and meet the following conditions:\n(A)\tThe measures retain existing vegetation and natural features of the drainageway where consistent with the master drainage plan.\n(B)\tAny land subject to flooding by a one hundred-year flood conforms to the requirements of Chapter 11-5, \"Stormwater and Flood Management Utility,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(C)\tStorm drainage improvements and storm sewers are maintained to collect drainage from the subdivision and convey it off-site into a city right-of-way or drainage system without adversely affecting adjacent property.\n(D)\tBridges, culverts, or open drainage channels are provided when required by the flood control utility master drainage plan.\n(E)\tAll subdivisions shall be designed to minimize flood damage.\n(F)\tAll subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities, including, without limitation, sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to prevent flood damage.\n(G)\tAll subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.\n(5)\tStandards for Fire Protection: Fire protection measures meet the following conditions:\n(A)\tFire hydrants are provided as required by Chapter 10-8, \"Fire Code,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(B)\tFire lanes are provided where necessary to protect the area; an easement at least sixteen feet wide for fire lanes is dedicated to the city, remains free of obstructions, and permits emergency access at all times.\n(b)\tWaiver of Lot Standards: The planning board may waive the design requirements of Paragraph (a)(1) of this section not otherwise required by any other provision of the code:\n(1)\tIf permitted as part of an approval under Section 9-7-12, \"Two Detached Dwellings on a Single Lot,\" B.R.C. 1981, or site review under Section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981; or\n(2)\tUpon request of the subdivider if the subdivider provides an alternative means of meeting the purposes of this chapter, which the board finds:\n(A)\tIs necessary because of unusual physical circumstances of the subdivision; or\n(B)\tProvides an improved design of the subdivision.\n(c)\tPrivate Utilities and Improvements: If the subdivider installs private utilities or improvements, including, without limitation, streets or water, wastewater and storm drain utilities, the subdivider shall provide mutual covenants in the deeds of all property owners of the subdivision for the continued and perpetual maintenance of the utilities or improvements. The city manager may require creation of a unit owners association formed pursuant to the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act, Article 33.3, Title 38, Colorado Revised Statutes, to own and maintain common private utilities and improvements.\n(d)\tApproval of Final Engineering Plans Required: No person shall construct or install any public or private utilities or improvements required by this chapter without first obtaining city manager review and approval of final engineering plans, profiles, and specifications therefor.\n(e)\tConstruction Timing: The subdivider shall construct and install on-site improvements and utilities (including, without limitation, streets adjoining the subdivision). If the city manager determines that it is in the best interest of the subdivision residents to postpone construction of an improvement so that the improvement can be constructed in conjunction with other city improvements, the subdivider shall deposit with the city funds sufficient to cover the cost of its construction or installation and promise to pay for any additional costs actually incurred; the city shall thereafter undertake such construction or installation when constructing or installing the related city improvements. If the city does not undertake construction of the related improvements within seven years of receipt of the funds, it shall return the funds to the current property owner(s).\n(f)\tInstallation of Off-Site Improvements: The subdivider shall install off-site improvements and utilities required by this section necessary to serve the development if the subdivider's construction on the subdivision precedes the construction of such improvements by the city under its capital improvements program.\n(1)\tPublic Improvement Extension Agreement: Prior to the extension of any public improvement or facility that is not entirely within the subdivision and for which the subdivider expects to receive reimbursement for part or all of the costs of the extension, the subdivider shall enter into a \"public improvement extension agreement\" with the city, which contains the legal description of the property to be served, a description of the improvement to be extended, the name of the owner of the property, the terms of the reimbursement to the owner, and an agreement by the subdivider to provide to the city, within sixty days after the date of preliminary construction acceptance by the city, its costs for such work and to provide to the city a current address during the term of the agreement.\n(2)\tForfeiture of Right to Reimbursement: If a subdivider fails to comply with the \"public improvement extension agreement,\" the subdivider forfeits its right to reimbursement under this subsection.\n(3)\tCollection and Repayment: At the time of annexation of, subdivision of, or issuance of a building permit for, whichever occurs first, a property abutting an improvement constructed under a \"public improvement extension agreement,\" the city manager shall collect a charge per adjusted front foot based upon the original construction costs and shall reimburse the original subdivider for its original construction costs, but only to the extent of the collection so made.\n(4)\tMaximum Amount Collected and Paid: In no event may the actual amount so paid to the subdivider by the city exceed the total original cost of the public improvement so extended. After the expiration of the period of reimbursement prescribed by Paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any such monies collected shall be retained by the city.\n(5)\tCity Manager Estimate of Cost of Public Improvement: If the subdivider fails to supply its costs to the city within sixty days of extending a public improvement, the manager may estimate the costs of such extension for purposes of charging persons who thereafter connect thereto.\n(6)\tReimbursement Term: The term for which the subdivider is entitled to reimbursement under the \"Public Improvement Extension Agreement\" entered into between the subdivider and the city is ten years from the date of execution of the contract or until the total original construction cost has been reimbursed, whichever occurs first.\n(g)\tOversized Improvements: The subdivider shall construct such oversized improvements and utilities that the city manager determines are necessary. If such oversized improvements are determined by the manager not to be required to serve the development, the city shall reimburse the subdivider for the cost of the oversized portion beyond the cost of the standard size within sixty days after the subdivider supplies its costs for the improvements to the city.\n(h)\tCity Manager Authorized to Require Other Public Improvements: The city manager may require such other public improvements not enumerated in this section as the manager determines are necessary to serve the health, safety, and welfare of the public and the prospective residents of the subdivision.\n(i)\tStreet Lights: If street lights are not provided by the subdivider, they will not thereafter be provided by the city, but may be installed through a local assessment district under Chapter 8-1, \"Local Improvements,\" B.R.C. 1981, for which benefited property owners will pay one hundred percent. Once street lights are installed, the city will pay for electricity and maintenance thereof.\n(j)\tSteep Slopes: The city manager may impose additional requirements over and above those required in subsection (a) of this section on lands containing slopes of fifteen percent or greater, if the manager determines such requirements are necessary in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants and taxpayers of Boulder from the negative impacts of development in hillside areas.\nOrdinance Nos. 4969 (1986); 5009 (1986); 5076 (1987); 5199 (1989); 5271 (1990); 5391 (1991); 5476 (1992); 5562 (1993); 5776 (1996); 5986 (1998); 7211 (2002); 7684 (2009); 7699 (2009); 7925 (2013); 8323 (2019); 8599 (2024); 8620 (2024)",

The subdivider shall complete such improvements and utilities within eighteen months of the issuance of the first building permit and prior to occupancy of any structure abutting the improvements. The manager may extend the required time period for completion to be consistent with phasing of construction of structures, or the manager may reduce the time upon a determination that, under generally accepted engineering principles, any or all of the improvements are required within a shorter time to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the subdivision.\n(d)\tThe city manager shall annually review the guarantee to assure that it meets the full current cost of constructing the improvements whose installation it secures and may require the subdivider to amend the guarantee to meet such current costs.\n(e)\tIf the improvements are not completed according to the subdivision agreement or the plat within the time required by subsection (c) of this section, the city may complete the improvements and collect against the guarantor for their full cost of construction and installation.\n(f)\tThe subdivider's financial guarantee may be any of the following:\n(1)\tAn escrow of funds with the city;\n(2)\tAn escrow with a bank or savings and loan association upon which the city can draw as provided in this section;\n(3)\tAn irrevocable clean sight draft or letter of commitment upon which the city can draw as provided in this section; or\n(4)\tAny other form of guarantee approved by the city manager that will satisfy the objectives of this section.\n(g)\tWhenever the city receives financial guarantees in the form of the escrow of funds, the city shall take such measures as it deems appropriate to ensure that such funds are maintained in a secure manner. Any interest earned on such funds while they are controlled by the city shall accrue to the sole benefit of the city to be used, in part, to offset administrative costs associated with the management and tracking of such funds. However, the city shall pay interest to existing escrow account holders who provided financial guarantees to the city in the form of escrows of funds prior to July 1, 1998. As to those existing escrow funds, interest shall be paid at a rate of return to be determined by the city manager on an annual basis in light of those rates of interest typically being paid by local financial institutions on regular passbook accounts.
