    "verbatim": "The schedule in Table 6-1 shows the uses that are permitted, conditionally permitted, prohibited, or that may be permitted through use review.\n(a)\tExplanation of Table Abbreviations: The abbreviations and symbols used in Table 6-1 of this section have the following meanings:\n(1)\tAllowed Uses: An \"A\" in a cell indicates that the use type is permitted by right in that zoning district, subject to compliance with any applicable specific use standards set forth in this chapter.\n(2)\tConditional Uses: A \"C\" in a cell indicates that the use type will be reviewed in accordance with the procedures established in Section 9-2-2, \"Administrative Review Procedures,\" B.R.C. 1981. Conditional use applications shall also meet any applicable specific use standards set forth in this chapter.\n(3)\tUse Review Uses: A \"U\" in a cell indicates that the use type will be reviewed in accordance with the procedures established in Section 9-2-15, \"Use Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. Use review applications shall also meet any applicable specific use standards set forth in this chapter.\n(4)\tProhibited Uses: A hyphen (\"-\") in a cell indicates that the use type is prohibited in that zoning district.\n(5)\tSpecific Use Standards: Cells containing bracket symbols (\"[ ]\") indicate that there are specific use standards associated with the use type in that district that must be complied with. Regardless of whether or not a use is allowed by right, conditional use, or use review, specific use standards may apply. The standards may require a different review process or impose certain limitations. The applicable specific use standards are identified and cross-referenced in the right-most column of Table 6-1. Several specific use standards may apply to a use type. If there is any inconsistency between the bracket designation in Table 6-1 and the specific use standards in Chapter 9-6, the specific use standards shall control.\n(b)\tAdditional Standards:\n(1)\tUses are also subject to all other applicable requirements of this title.\n(2)\tAdditional Use Standards in Form-Based Code Areas or Overlay Districts:\n(A)\tUses in Form-Based Code Areas: Uses located on a lot or parcel designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" are subject to the requirements of this chapter, but, if developed pursuant to a form-based code review, may also be subject to additional use standards pursuant to Chapter 9-14, \"Form-Based Code.\"\n(B)\tUses in Overlay Districts: Uses located on a lot or parcel located within an overlay district designated in Chapter 9-3, \"Overlay Districts,\" B.R.C. 1981, are subject to the requirements of this chapter, but may also be subject to additional use standards pursuant to the overlay district standards described in that chapter.\n(c)\tStructure of the Use Classification System: Land uses are organized according to a three-tiered hierarchy consisting of use classifications, use categories, and use types. This classification system is intended to provide a structure that groups similar uses together for ease in locating or identifying a use and to simplify the classification of new uses.\n(1)\tUse Classifications: Each use is grouped under one of these seven broad use classifications: Residential Uses; Public, Institutional, and Community Uses; Commercial Uses; Industrial Uses; Agricultural and Natural Resource Uses.\n(2)\tUse Categories: Use categories are subgroups of uses in each classification that have common functional or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, types of goods, services, occupants or users/customers, or operational characteristics.\n(3)\tUse Types: Use types are the specific land uses that can be established in a zoning district, such as duplex, restaurant, or building material sales.\n(d)\tInterpretation: The city manager may decide questions of interpretation as to which use type that a use not specifically listed in Table 6-1 is properly assigned to, based on precedents, similar situations, and relative impacts. Upon written application, a city manager interpretation as to which use type a use not specifically listed is properly assigned to may be appealed to the BOZA pursuant to Section 9-2-3, \"Variances and Interpretations,\" B.R.C. 1981. Any use not specifically listed in Table 6-1 of this section is not allowed unless it is determined to be included in a use type as provided by this section.\n(e)\tMultiple Uses of Land Permitted and Accessory Uses: Allowed uses, conditional uses, and uses permitted by use review may be located in the same building or upon the same lot. Any use may be allowed as an accessory use if it meets the definition of an accessory use.\nTABLE 6-1: USE TABLE\nOrdinance Nos. 8523 (2022); 8556 (2023); 8571 (2023); 8590 (2023); 8599 (2024); 8650 (2025); 8669 (2025)",

    "verbatim": "(a)\tPurpose: The purpose of this chapter is to set forth additional requirements for specified uses of land. The requirements are intended to ensure that the use is compatible with the surrounding area.\n(b)\tScope: Specific use standards are the standards contained in Sections 9-6-2 through 9-6-7, B.R.C. 1981. Specific use standards apply as follows:\n(1)\tAllowed Uses: Uses that are permitted by right and are subject to specific use standards in this chapter shall be established, operated, and maintained in compliance with any applicable specific use standards. The establishment of these uses is not subject to a review procedure.\n(2)\tConditional Uses: Uses that may be approved as a conditional use are uses that are appropriate in a given zoning district if the applicant demonstrates that the use meets the applicable specific use standards of this chapter. Conditional uses will be reviewed pursuant to the procedures in Section 9-2-2, \"Administrative Review Procedures,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tUse Review Uses: Uses that require a use review are uses that are suitable in a location if the applicant demonstrates that the use meets the use review criteria in Section 9-2-15, \"Use Review,\" B.R.C. 1981, and the applicable specific use standards of this chapter.Use reviews will be reviewed pursuant to the procedures in Section 9-2-15, B.R.C. 1981.\n(c)\tSpecific Use Standards that Apply to Several Use Types: The specific use standards in this chapter are generally organized by use classification, use category, and use type. Some specific use standards apply to several use types that are part of different use classifications and use categories. Such standards that apply to use types within different classifications are set forth within this subsection (c).\n(1)\tSpecific Use Standards for Uses in the BC Zoning Districts:\n(A)\tReview Process: In the BC-1 and BC-2 zoning districts, the following standards apply to the uses listed in Table 6-2:\nTABLE 6-2: USES WITH SPECIFIC USE STANDARDS IN THE BC-1 AND BC-2 ZONING DISTRICTS\n(i)\tAllowed Use: The uses listed in Table 6-2 are allowed by right unless the use is located within an area designated in Appendix N \"Business Community (BC) Areas Subject to Special Use Restrictions.\"\n(ii)\tConditional Use: If located in one of the mapped areas in Appendix N, the use may be approved as a conditional use if it meets all of the following standards:\na.\tThe use shall not be located on the ground floor, with the exception of minimum necessary ground level access.\nb.\tThe combined floor area of any nonresidential uses in Table 6-2 shall be limited to ten percent of the total floor area on the lot or parcel except that if the use is located within an approved site review or planned unit development, the combined floor area of any nonresidential uses subject to this section shall be limited to ten percent of the total floor area within the boundaries of the site review or planned unit development approval in the BC zoning district.\nc.\tA principal use of any automobile parking lot or garage shall be a park and ride facility.\n(iii)\tUse Review: A use that is not allowed by right or as a conditional use may be approved only pursuant to a use review. In addition to meeting the use review criteria, the applicant shall demonstrate that the use on the ground floor or with a combined floor area larger than ten percent of the total floor area, as applicable, will not adversely affect the intended function and character of the area as a neighborhood serving business area where retail-type stores predominate on the ground floor. In determining whether this criterion is met, the reviewing authority shall consider the location and design of the proposed use and the existing and approved uses on the lot or parcel and in the area.\nOrdinance Nos. 8523 (2022); 8556 (2023); 8697 (2025)",
