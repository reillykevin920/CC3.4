The purpose of this chapter is to allow these nonconforming uses and nonstandard buildings to be changed and upgraded without requiring their elimination, if the change would not substantially adversely affect the surrounding area and if the change would not increase the degree of nonconformity of the use. Additionally, this chapter sets standards that allow the development of nonstandard lots.",

The city manager may extend time to start work under subsection (b) to restore a structure or building that has been damaged by flooding if such work is started no later than March 1, 2016 and is completed within twenty-four months of the date on which the restoration is commenced.
