The setback for the adjacent buildings and other buildings on the block face shall be measured from the property line to the bulk of the building, excluding, without limitation, any unenclosed porches, decks, patios or steps. The bulk of the building setback shall not be less than the average bulk of the building setback for the principal buildings on the two adjacent lots. Where there is only one adjacent lot, the front yard setback reduction shall be based on the average of the principal building setbacks on the two closest lots on the same block face. (See Figure 7-1 of this section.)\nFigure 7-1: Setback Averaging Example\nIn this example, lots \"B\" through \"F\" are the face block. Lot \"A\" is not included in the face block, as the front of this lot is on a different street. Setback averaging is measured to the bulk of the buildings and does not include porches.\nAssuming this block is zoned RL-1, the minimum required front yard setback would be twenty-five feet. The block face shown would qualify for setback averaging, as more than fifty percent of the principal buildings do not meet the required front yard setback. An addition to the front of lot \"E\" would require the averaging of the setbacks of lots \"D\" and \"F\", the two closest buildings on the same block face. In this example the resulting setback would be 20 feet - the average of lot \"D\" (fifteen feet) and lot \"F\" (twenty-five feet). An addition to the front of lot \"F\" would be based on the average of the two closest buildings on the same block face; in this case, lots \"D\" and \"E.\"\n(c)\tSide Yard Setback Standards:\n(1)\tSetbacks for Upper Floors in Non-Residential Zoning Districts: A principal building constructed with a side yard setback of zero for the first story above grade in the BC-2, BR-1, DT-1, DT-2, DT-3, DT-4, DT-5, IS-1, IG or IM zoning districts, where the side yard setback is noted as \"0 or 12,\" may have upper stories set back either five feet or the distance required by Chapter 10-5 \"Building Code,\" B.R.C. 1981, whichever is greater.\n(2)\tMaintenance Easements Required in Residential Zoning Districts: In residential zoning districts that allow a zero side yard or rear yard setback, the applicant shall be required to secure a recorded maintenance easement from the adjoining property owner if the zero setback side is not attached to another structure. The easement shall be effective for the life of the building. The easement shall not be less than three feet in width measured parallel to that portion of the building at zero setback.\n(3)\tWall Height for Residential Zero Lot Line: The maximum wall height for detached dwelling units at the zero setback property line shall be twelve feet. Townhouses, consistent with Subparagraph (7), below, are not subject to this restriction.\n(4)\tCalculating Residential Zero Lot Line Side Yard Setbacks: For detached dwelling units, the side yard setback opposite the zero setback property line shall be the sum of both side yards for the district.\n(5)\tCombined Side Yard Setbacks: When combined side yard setbacks are required by Section 9-7-1, \"Schedule of Form and Bulk Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, the resulting structure, including the existing structure and any addition, must meet the combined side yard setback requirements. (See Figure 7-2 of this section for compliant and noncompliant examples.)\nFigure 7-2: Combined Side Yard Setbacks\nExample: In the RL-1 district, the combination of side yard setbacks must be no less than fifteen feet, with a minimum of five feet. Both existing structures and additions (hatched) are included in the calculation.\n(6)\tExisting Nonstandard Side Yard Setbacks for Existing Detached Dwelling Units: A second story addition that does not comply with the minimum interior or combined side yard setbacks may be added to an existing detached dwelling unit subject to the following:\n(A)\tThe interior side yard setback for the existing detached dwelling unit complied with the setback requirements in existence at the time of initial construction and was not created by a variance or other procedure;\n(B)\tThe resulting interior side yard setback will not be less than five feet and combined side yard setbacks will not be less than ten feet;\n(C)\tThat portion of the building in the side yard setback shall vertically align with the existing first-story wall.\n(7)\tTownhouses: There is no minimum side yard setback from an interior lot line between one townhouse and an adjoining townhouse.\n(8)\tSetback Relative to Building Height: For buildings subject to the side yard setback requirements based on building height, the setback shall be determined consistent with Figure 7-3.\nFigure 7-3: Setback Relative to Building Height\n(d)\tRear Yard Setbacks: Where a rear yard backs on a street, the rear yard shall have a minimum landscaped setback equal to the minimum front yard landscaped setback from a street for all buildings and uses required for that zone.\n(e)\tOpen Parking Areas, Flagpoles, and Detached Garages and Carports: Open parking areas, flagpoles, and detached garages and carports may be located in compliance with either the required principal building setbacks or accessory building setbacks.\n(f)\tSwimming Pools, Spas, and Hot Tubs: Swimming pools, spas, and hot tubs shall be located according to the applicable accessory structure setbacks on a lot except that pools, spas, or hot tubs may be located in compliance with the required front yard principal building setback.\n(g)\tOil and Gas Operations and Other Uses: Oil and gas operations shall be set back from any residential use, residential zone, school, daycare center, hospital, senior living facility, assisted living facility, outdoor venue, playground, permanent sports field, amphitheater, public park and recreation use, or other similar public outdoor facility, but not including trails or City of Boulder open space, in accordance with the standards of Section 9-6-7(b)(2), B.R.C. 1981.

The city manager will determine if the screening of the equipment is adequate in form, materials and color based on the following criteria:\n(A)\tScreening is consistent with the building design, colors and materials;\n(B)\tAppurtenances are placed on the portion of the roof which is least visible from adjacent streets and properties;\n(C)\tThe height of the screen is the minimum appropriate to adequately screen the mechanical equipment; and\n(D)\tScreening does not increase the apparent height of the walls of the building. The use of parapet walls to screen mechanical equipment is discouraged. The height of parapet walls should be the minimum necessary to screen mechanical equipment.\n(5)\tA parapet wall may exceed the height requirements of this title by up to eighteen inches if the parapet is necessary to accommodate rooftop drainage or to provide fire protection.\n(6)\tAn applicant may appeal the decision of the manager under this section to the planning board under the procedures set forth in Section 9-2-7, \"Development Review Action,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(b)\tLandmarked Appurtenances: Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, appurtenances of buildings landmarked under Chapter 9-11, \"Historic Preservation,\" B.R.C. 1981, may be repaired or restored to their previous height, upon approval of the landmarks board. If the board approves such a repair or restoration, the approval is not effective until thirty days after the date of its approval. Promptly after the approval of the repair or restoration, the city manager will forward to the city council a written report, including a description of the repair or restoration and the reasons for the approval. The manager will publish notice of the approval once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City within thirty days after the approval is granted by the board. Upon receiving such report and at any time before the effective date of the approval, the council may rescind the approval and call-up the request for its consideration at a public hearing, which constitutes a revocation of the approval.\n(c)\tRooftop Solar Systems: Rooftop solar systems shall comply with the requirements of this subsection:\n(1)\tThe rooftop solar system may exceed the roof area coverage requirements in Paragraph (a)(3) if:\n(A)\tThe system is under fifty-five feet in height; or\n(B)\tThe system complies with the following limitation for buildings or rooftop solar systems that exceed fifty-five feet in height.
