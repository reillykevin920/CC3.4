    "verbatim": "(a)\tSubsection Heading, with text in the paragraph appearing as hanging indent for the entire Title as shown in this paragraph.\n(1)\tParagraph Heading, with text in the paragraph appearing as hanging indent for the entire Title as shown in this paragraph.\n(A)\tSubparagraph Heading, with text in the paragraph appearing as hanging indent for the entire Title as shown in this paragraph.\nWhen necessary, the numbering system continues beyond the subparagraph heading following a similar pattern of numbering and indentation. Each section includes all material between two section headings. For example, Section 9-1-1 includes all material beginning with the number 9-1-1 up to number 9-1-2. References to any division of this title include all material located within the referenced section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, etc.\n(b)\tZoning Map: Zoning districts are the primary tool for regulating land in Boulder. Prior to considering developing land, an applicant should refer to the official zoning map to determine which zoning district his/her property is located within. The official zoning map is available at the planning department.\n(c)\tModular Zone System: Zoning districts in Boulder are comprised of standards from three modules: use, form and intensity. Combining elements of the three modules creates a zoning district. The zoning districts are identified in Section 9-5-2, \"Zoning Districts,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(1)\tUse Module: The use module establishes the uses that are permitted, may be approved as a conditional use pursuant to Section 9-2-2, \"Administrative Review Procedures,\" B.R.C. 1981, prohibited, or that may be approved through a use review pursuant to Section 9-2-15, \"Use Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. Conditional uses are reviewed through an administrative (staff) review process to ensure conformance with specific use standards. If the use requires a use review, then the project will be required to complete a discretionary review to ensure that any impacts of the use on the surrounding area are minimized. Finally, if the use is an existing legal use that is no longer allowed in the zoning district, and there is a proposal to change or modify the use, it may also be required to complete a use review.\n(2)\tForm Module: The form module establishes the physical parameters for development such as setbacks, building coverage, height and special building design characteristics. Solar access standards, located in Section 9-9-17, \"Solar Access,\" B.R.C. 1981, may also impact building form and should be reviewed in conjunction with the form standards. On parcels and lots designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" the regulations of Chapter 9-14, \"Form-Based Code,\" apply.\n(3)\tIntensity Module: The intensity module establishes the density at which development may occur and includes: minimum lot sizes, minimum open space per dwelling unit, number of dwelling units per acre, minimum open space per lot or parcel, and floor area ratios when applicable. On parcels and lots designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" the regulations of Chapter 9-14, \"Form-Based Code,\" apply.\n(4)\tForm-Based Code Review: The requirements for the form-based code review process are found in Section 9-2-16, \"Form-Based Code Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. Parcels and lots designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" may be subject to the requirements of Chapter 9-14, \"Form-Based Code,\" and may be required to complete a form-based code review. Projects on lots or parcels designated in Appendix L, \"Form-Based Code Areas,\" and eligible for a site review process may complete a site review or form-based code review. Projects required to complete or completing a form-based code review, are not eligible for the variance process.\n(d)\tOverlay Districts and Development Standards: In addition to the zoning district standards, there are additional sets of standards that may be applicable to a property, depending on its location. The applicant should check with the planning department to find out if the property is subject to such regulations, based on the official maps available from the department. First, the applicant should determine if the property is located within a floodplain. Standards regulating lands in the floodplain are found in Sections 9-3-2 through 9-3-8, B.R.C. 1981. If the property is located near the airport, the applicant should determine if the property is located within the airport influence overlay zone. Those standards are located in Section 9-3-10, \"Airport Influence Zone,\" B.R.C. 1981. The applicant should also determine if the property contains any significant wetlands. These regulations are found in Section 9-3-9, \"Stream, Wetlands and Water Body Protection,\" B.R.C. 1981. Finally, the applicant should determine if the property is a designated landmark or located in a designated historic district. Standards regulating historic preservation are located in Chapter 9-11, \"Historic Preservation,\" B.R.C. 1981. In all cases, these overlay district standards apply in addition to any standards of the underlying zoning district. For example, the floodplain overlay regulations may limit or prohibit expansion of existing structures on portions of lots located in the floodplain, even though the basic zone standards would allow it. Other types of overlays may supplement the basic zone standards. For example, a property within the airport influence zone may limit uses or building heights beyond what the base zone standards allow.\n(e)\tDevelopment Standards: Chapter 9-9, \"Development Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, includes development standards that apply in addition to the zoning and overlay district standards. These include standards for parking, landscaping, signs, open space, site access, lighting, solar access and other elements of development.\n(f)\tVariances of Standards/Site Review Process/Form-Based Code Review Process:\n(1)\tIf the applicant cannot meet the standards described in Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the applicant should determine whether there are alternative development options or any exceptions to the general rules in the code that may accommodate the project. If the project does not meet standards and other development alternatives are not possible, then there are two basic methods available to attempt to vary the standards: the variance process and the site review process.\n(2)\tThe variance process is generally used for existing development. Bulk and form requirements may be varied if the applicant can demonstrate an unusual physical circumstance or other hardship. The variance requirements are found in Section 9-2-3, \"Variances and Interpretations,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(3)\tThe requirements for the site review process are found in Section 9-2-14, \"Site Review,\" B.R.C. 1981. If the project is large enough to meet the minimum thresholds set forth in the code, then the bulk and form requirements and other specified development standards may be modified as part of a unified development proposal through a site review. If the project is smaller than the minimum thresholds standards, it is not eligible for site review. All projects that exceed the maximum site review threshold will be required to complete a site review.\n(g)\tNonconformance Standards: Adoption of land use controls and changes in zoning have created nonconforming uses, nonstandard buildings and nonstandard lots. Chapter 9-10, \"Nonconformance Standards,\" B.R.C. 1981, describes the treatment of these nonconformities. In general, the policy of the City is to allow these nonconforming uses and nonstandard buildings to be changed and upgraded without requiring their elimination if the change would not substantially adversely affect the surrounding area and if the change would not increase the degree of nonconformity of the use.\n(h)\tSubdivision of Land: If the applicant would like to subdivide a piece of property or merge a number of different parcels into one parcel, the applicant may need to go through the subdivision process. The purpose of the subdivision process is to ensure that proposed building sites are appropriate for development; to obtain an accurate and permanent record of the separate interests of land that are created by subdivision of land; to apportion the costs of public services and facilities serving the subdivision; to provide assurances to future buyers of land that the subdivider owns the land to be sold; to provide legal and physical access to each lot; and to provide for maintenance of improvements, utilities and amenities. There are a number of divisions of land to which the subdivision regulations do not apply. The applicant should review these exceptions to determine if the project will be required to complete the subdivision process. There is also an abbreviated process for projects that only require elimination of a lot line between two lots within an existing subdivision. The subdivision process is found in Chapter 9-12, \"Subdivision,\" B.R.C. 1981. The exceptions are found in Section 9-12-2, \"Application of Chapter,\" B.R.C. 1981. The minor subdivision process is found in Section 9-12-5, \"Minor Subdivision,\" B.R.C. 1981. The abbreviated process for lot line eliminations, lot line adjustments and minor subdivisions is found in Section 9-12-4, \"Elimination of Lot Lines,\" B.R.C. 1981.\n(i)\tInclusionary Housing: The City has adopted regulations to assist in providing a diverse housing stock affordable to people of varying incomes. Chapter 9-13, \"Inclusionary Housing,\" B.R.C. 1981, sets forth the standards for the City's inclusionary housing and moderate income housing programs. Inclusionary housing requires that most new residential development contribute toward permanent affordable housing in the City. Generally speaking, twenty percent of the total number of units are required to be permanently affordable to low income households.\n(j)\tEnforcement of The Land Use Regulations: Violations of the land use regulation are investigated by the Planning Department and are prosecuted in municipal court, by district court actions or through administrative hearings. A hearing also is available before the Planning Board to protest a violation of a development review approval. The enforcement provisions are found in Chapter 9-15, \"Enforcement,\" B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance Nos. 7658 (2009); 7701 (2010); 8121 (2016); 8337 (2019); 8523 (2022); 8600 (2024); 8669 (2025)",
