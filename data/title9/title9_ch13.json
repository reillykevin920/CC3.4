    "verbatim": "(a)\tA diverse housing stock is necessary in this community to serve people of all income levels. Based upon the review and consideration of recent housing studies, reports and analysis, it has become clear that the provisions of this chapter are necessary to preserve a diversity of housing opportunities for the city's residents and working people.\n(b)\tThe program defined by this chapter is necessary to provide continuing housing opportunities for very low-, low-, moderate-, and middle-income households. It is necessary to help maintain a diverse housing stock and to allow people to have better access to jobs and upgrade their economic status. It is necessary to provide housing to persons of all needs and abilities to have a place in the community. The strong employment base in this region, combined with the special attractiveness of Boulder, its University-related population and its environmentally sensitive urban service boundaries, all combine to make the continued provision of decent housing options for very low-, low-, moderate and middle-income and working people in Boulder a difficult but vital objective. The regional trend toward increasing housing prices will, without intervention, result in inadequate supplies of affordable housing here for very low-, low-, moderate and middle-income households. This in turn will have a negative effect upon the ability of local employers to maintain an adequate local work force.\n(c)\tIt is essential that appropriate housing options exist for university students, faculty and staff so that the housing needs of university-related populations do not preclude non-university community members from finding affordable housing.\n(d)\tA housing shortage for persons of very low-, low-, moderate and middle-income is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare. The inability of such persons to reside within the city negatively affects the community's jobs/housing balance and has serious and detrimental transportation and environmental consequences.\n(e)\tBecause remaining land appropriate for residential development within the city is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be developed into housing units affordable to very low-, low-, moderate and middle-income residents and working people. This is particularly true because of the tendency, in the absence of interventions, for large expensive housing to be developed within the city, which both reduces opportunities for more affordable housing and contributes to a general rise in prices for all housing in the community, thus exacerbating the scarcity of affordable housing within the city.\n(f)\tThe primary objective of this chapter is to obtain a significant amount of permanently affordable dwelling units. Provisions of this chapter provide for various approaches to creating additional affordable housing units. Those provisions recognize the fact that individual site, legal and economic factors have an impact on which alternatives will work for different developments.\n(g)\tThe intent of this chapter is that any resulting affordable housing units and developments will be distributed either within each development when provided on-site or at a building/neighborhood level when provided off-site and will be found throughout the community and not concentrated in certain areas of the city.\n(h)\tAs land for new residential development becomes scarcer, redevelopment of existing housing will increase. The newly built housing that results will likely be more expensive than the housing it replaces. This is especially true of larger redevelopments. Smaller scale developments are less able to absorb development costs than are larger developments that can benefit from economies of scale. This chapter recognizes the differences between developments of different sizes and the inherent inefficiencies in smaller developments and seeks to not disproportionally affect smaller redevelopments within the City.\n(i)\tThis inclusionary housing requirement is based upon the city's power to enact zoning regulations that promote the health, safety and welfare of the community. For the reasons cited above, the promotion and maintenance of a diverse housing stock is an important component of the city's zoning regulations.\nOrdinance Nos. 8201 (2017); 8601 (2024)",

    "verbatim": "(a)\tPurpose: In order to create a significant amount of permanently affordable units, to the extent permitted by this chapter, developers may satisfy the inclusionary housing requirement through any combination of the following alternate means:\n(1)\tCash-in-Lieu Contribution: Developers may satisfy permanently affordable housing requirements by making cash contributions to the city's affordable housing fund. The cash-in-lieu contribution will be based on the residential square footage of the development creating the inclusionary housing requirement and the applicable rate will be determined annually by the city manager. The city manager may consider the number of units in the development, the size and type of units which created the obligation , the amount that would incentivize on-site construction of permanently affordable units, and the affordability gap between market rate and permanently affordable unit prices when determining the cash-in-lieu calculation.\n(A)\tAnnual Cash-in-lieu Escalator: The city manager is authorized to adjust the cash-in-lieu contribution annually on January 1 of each year.\n(B)\tAffordable Housing Fund Established: The city manager will establish an affordable housing fund for the receipt and management of permanently affordable unit cash-in-lieu contributions. Monies received into that fund will be utilized solely for the construction, purchase and maintenance of affordable housing and for the costs of administering programs consistent with the purposes of this chapter.\n(2)\tProvision of Affordable Units Off-site:\n(A)\tThe intent of this option is that the off-site unit mix of permanently affordable units will be proportionate in type and size to the mix of market rate units in the development that generated the requirement for the permanently affordable units (the \"Sending Site\"). Recognizing that an off-site location is unique and may have different zoning and other planning considerations than the Sending Site, the city manager may meet the intent of this chapter by modifying the requirements in Sections 9-13-6 and 9-13-7, B.R.C. 1981, to accommodate the off-site constraints.\n(B)\tTo the extent permitted by this chapter, inclusionary housing requirements may be satisfied by restricting existing or newly constructed rental or for-sale off-site dwelling units which are approved by the city manager as suitable permanently affordable units through covenants, contractual arrangements or resale restrictions, the form and content of which are acceptable to the city manager. Off-site permanently affordable units shall be located within the City of Boulder.\n(C)\tThe city manager is authorized to develop rules for approving, assessing, and monitoring the off-site development.\n(D)\tOff-site Agreement: Any development meeting the requirements of this chapter by providing permanently affordable units off-site shall be subject to the provisions of an off-site agreement as approved by the city manager. The off-site agreement must be executed prior to application for any residential building permit for the Sending Site.\n(E)\tFinancial Guarantee: The city manager may require a financial guarantee to secure the off-site units prior to issuing a building permit for the Sending Site.\n(F)\tTiming of Construction for Off-site Units: The intent of this section is to provide concurrency of construction and marketing between permanently affordable units and market rate units.\n(i)\tIf newly constructed dwelling units are used to satisfy the requirements of this chapter as permanently affordable units the applicant shall demonstrate that such units meet the following minimum requirements:\na.\tThe permanently affordable units shall pass final inspection no later than one year after the last market rate unit in the Sending Site passes final inspection; and\nb.\tThe permanently affordable units shall be offered for sale or rent no later than one year after the final inspection of the last market rate unit in the Sending Site.\n(ii)\tIf existing dwelling units are used to satisfy the requirements of this chapter as permanently affordable units, the applicant shall demonstrate that such units meet the following minimum requirements:\na.\tThe applicant provides a letter of completion for any rehabilitation or remodeling, subject to city manager review and approval, that establishes that the permanently affordable units are habitable no later than one year after the last market rate unit in the Sending Site receives a certificate of occupancy; and\nb.\tThe permanently affordable units are offered for sale or rent no later than one year after the last market rate unit in the Sending Site receives a certificate of occupancy.\n(G)\tTiming of Marketing: The marketing of the permanently affordable units should start two months before the permanently affordable units are expected to receive a certificate of occupancy.\n(H)\tOff-Site Location Subject to Inclusionary Requirement: All newly constructed permanently affordable units provided off-site are subject to the requirements of this chapter.\n(I)\tOff-Site Location Review and Approval: Any proposed off-site location is required to be approved by the city manager.\n(3)\tLand Dedication:\n(A)\tPurpose: The inclusionary housing requirement may be satisfied by the dedication of land to the City of Boulder or an entity designated by the City of Boulder for permanently affordable units in accordance with the provisions of this.\n(B)\tGeneral Requirements: A land dedication shall meet all of the following criteria to the satisfaction of the city:\n(i)\tThe location of the land would meet city affordable housing objectives and is required to be approved by the city manager;\n(ii)\tThe land can reasonably be developed for affordable housing;\n(iii)\tThe land is in an environmentally acceptable condition as supported by a Phase I Environmental Assessment as approved by the city manager. The city manager may require other studies or assessments to make this determination;\n(iv)\tNo greater than ten percent of the land may be within the high hazard zone or conveyance zone. No greater than twenty-five percent of the land may be within the one-hundred-year floodplain. If any portion of the land is in the high hazard zone, conveyance zone or one-hundred-year floodplain, the city manager will have the sole discretion to determine if the land is appropriate for affordable housing development.\n(v)\tSatisfactory proof of title is provided to the city manager within thirty days before the effective date of dedication to the city or an entity designated by the city for such dedication. The land will be free of all liens and encumbrances and all property taxes and special taxes will be current before the title for the dedicated land is conveyed. The land will be conveyed by special warranty deed before issuance of a building permit for the Sending Site.\n(vi)\tDedicated land plus any cash-in-lieu contributed must be of equivalent or greater value to the total cash-in-lieu contribution amount. The value of the land will be determined, at the cost of the developer, by an independent appraiser, who will be selected from a list of Colorado Certified General Appraiser provided by the city, or by such alternative means of valuation to which a developer and the city may agree.\n(vii)\tIf the land does not equal the full amount of the cash-in-lieu owed, the applicant shall contribute cash-in-lieu to make up any gap between the value of the donated land and the total cash-in-lieu contribution amount.\n(C)\tOpen Space Requirement: If land proposed to be dedicated under this subparagraph is part of the same site review as the market rate units that create the inclusionary housing requirement the open space requirements for any permanently affordable units constructed on the land proposed to be dedicated shall be met entirely on the land proposed to be dedicated and the open space requirements for the market rate units shall be met entirely within the market rate unit development.\n(4)\tAlternative methods of compliance. The city manager is authorized to enter into agreements to allow alternative methods of compliance for the inclusionary housing requirements contained within this chapter. The applicant shall provide all documentation and any other material requested by the city manager. An applicant for an alternative method of compliance will demonstrate that the proposed method of compliance:\n(A)\tWill result in additional affordable housing benefits for the city consistent with the purposes of this chapter; or\n(B)\tWill address unmet housing needs; or\n(C)\tIs necessary to prevent an unlawful taking of property without just compensation in accordance with Section 9-13-15, \"No Taking of Property Without Just Compensation,\" B.R.C. 1981.\nOrdinance Nos. 8201 (2017); 8601 (2024); 8620 (2024)",
