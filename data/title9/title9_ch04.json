At least one sign shall be posted on each street frontage.\n(5)\tThe signs shall remain in place during the period leading up to a decision by the approving authority, but not less than ten days.\n(6)\tOn or before the date that the approving authority is scheduled to make a decision on the application, the city manager will require the applicant to certify in writing that required notice will be posted according to the requirements of this section.\n(d)\tPublished Notice: Published notice is required for all public hearings and good neighbor meetings.

Upon such a finding, the approving authority shall continue the review process or hearing for at least ten days. Any omission or defect in the public notice that is not brought to the approving authority's attention or that the authority finds did not impair a surrounding property owner's ability to participate in the review process shall not affect the validity of the proceedings.\nOrdinance Nos. 6093 (1999); 7117 (2001); 7210 (2002); 8121 (2016); 8235 (2018); 8514 (2021); 8571 (2023); 8620 (2024); 8622 (2024)",

Any person aggrieved by the final decision of the City may seek judicial review of the decision by filing a complaint pursuant to the Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 106(a)(4).\nOrdinance Nos. 7663 (2009); 7838 (2012); 8121 (2016); 8622 (2024)",
