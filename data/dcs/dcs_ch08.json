The formula shall\nindicate the aggregate gradation, asphalt cement content, hydrated lime content,\nand optimum density. If requested by the Director, a sample of the aggregate and\nasphalt cement shall be submitted for approval (for test purposes) prior to placing\nany hot bituminous pavement.\n(b) The job-mix formula for each mixture shall establish a single percentage of\naggregate passing each required sieve size, a single percentage of bituminous\nmaterial to be added to the aggregate, and a single temperature for the mixture at\nthe discharge point of the plant.\n(c) When submitting the job-mix formula, the contractor shall supply certified test\nresults on all asphalt cements, aggregates, and mixes used for hot bituminous\npavement, and certify that all materials meet or exceed all required specifications\nand tests.\n(d) The Director reserves the right to sample materials and mixtures throughout\nproject construction to determine whether specifications and requirements have\nbeen met and to confirm the certified test results. The contractor is responsible for\nproviding a bituminous mixture that meets the job formula and specifications.\n(e) The contractor shall be responsible for providing adequate field testing of\nmaterials used on the project and providing copies of the test results to the City to\nassure compliance with these specifications.\n(f) The top layer of hot bituminous pavement shall not contain any reclaimed asphalt\nmaterial, unless approved by the Director.\n(2) Subsection 401.11, “Tack Coat,” is amended to incorporate the following additions:\n(a) A tack coat shall be evenly applied to all existing asphalt or concrete surfaces that\nwill be in contact with asphalt prior to hot bituminous pavement placement. A\nslow-setting, diluted emulsion shall be used, diluted with one part water to one\npart asphalt emulsion. The rate of application shall be 0.1 gallons per square yard\nof diluted asphalt emulsion. Before dilution, the emulsified asphalt shall comply\nwith AASHTO M140 or M208.\n(b) Only the amount of tack coat necessary for the day's operation is to be placed on\nthe surface. All traffic not essential to the work shall be kept off the tack coat.\n(3) Subsection 401.12, “Surface Conditioning,” is amended to incorporate the following\naddition: All vegetation shall be removed from any existing surface to be overlaid.\n(4) Subsection 401.16, “Spreading and Finishing,” is amended to incorporate the following\nadditions:\n(a) The bituminous mixture shall be placed with an asphalt paver if possible. The\ncontractor shall receive permission from the Director to use placement methods\nother than a paver. The lift thickness shall be at least twice the maximum particle\nsize for the hot bituminous pavement mix. The maximum lift thickness for the\nfinal lift shall be 2 inches, unless otherwise approved by the Director.\n(b) Areas to be patched shall be excavated and squared to a neat line, leaving the\nsides of the excavation vertical. Prior to placement of the patch, the exposed sides\nof the existing pavement shall be thoroughly coated with slow-setting Emulsified\nAsphalt. Hot bituminous pavement shall then be placed and compacted in\nsucceeding layers; no layer shall be more than 3 inches deep."

The Director may\napprove the following Non Standard closures upon finding that the applicable criteria have been\nmet:\n(1) Work Hours: Plans which propose to close a vehicular travel lane on any weekday prior\nto 9 a.m. or later than 4 p.m., or on any weekend shall demonstrate that such impacts\ncannot be reasonably avoided or that the proposed schedule reduces impacts to the public\ncompared to closure during normal work hours.\n(2) Multiple Vehicle Lanes: Plans which propose to close all or multiple vehicle lanes in a\nsingle direction of travel shall demonstrate that such impacts cannot be reasonably avoided\nthrough alternative scheduling or phasing of work.\n(3) Vehicular Detours: Plans which propose to detour traffic to another roadway shall\ndemonstrate that such impacts cannot be reasonably avoided and that impacts to the detour\nroute have been mitigated to the extent practicable. Impacts to the detour route shall be\nevaluated including, without limitation, intersection level of service, traffic speed and\nvolume in residential neighborhoods and school zones, and impacts to all modes of\ntransportation.\n(4) Flagging: Plans which propose use of flaggers shall demonstrate that the duration or\nscope of work is such that more permanent control measures are not practical.\n(5) Transit Facilities: Plans which propose impacts to a transit facility or transit stop must\ndemonstrate that such impacts cannot be avoided and provide for appropriate detours and\nalternative stop locations.\n(6) Sidewalks: The following special considerations shall be given to proposed closures of\nsidewalks:\na) Adjacent to streets not classified as “Local” in the Transportation Master Plan;\nb) Located in the CAGID or UHGID boundary areas;\nc) Impacted for more than seven days;\nd) Where no other sidewalk exists adjacent to the roadway;\ne) Serving a school zone or transit stop, or\nf) Requiring pedestrians to detour to a facility on a separate parallel roadway. Such\nproposed closures must demonstrate that impacts cannot be avoided through\nalternative construction methods, that the duration and extent of impacts has been\nminimized, and that an adequate detour has been provided.\n(7) Bicycle Lanes: Special consideration shall be given to proposed closures of on street\nbike lanes along roadways with a posted speed limit of 40 mph or greater; or bike lanes\nthat involve contra-flow lanes. Such proposed closures shall demonstrate that impacts\ncannot be avoided through alternative construction methods, that the facility cannot be\nreasonably relocated through reassignment of vehicle lanes or other existing facilities, that\nthe duration and extent of impacts has been minimized, and that an adequate detour has\nbeen provided.\n(8) Multi-Use Paths: Special consideration shall be given to proposed closures of sidewalk\nfacilities which have been designated as multi-use paths. Such proposals shall\ndemonstrate that impacts cannot be avoided through alternative construction methods, that\nthe facility cannot be reasonably relocated through reassignment of vehicle lanes or other\nexisting facilities, that the duration and extent of impacts has been minimized, and that an\nadequate detour has been provided. Detours routes must be of similar width and surface\ntype to the permanent facility.\n(9) Signage: Where detours or closures impact pedestrian, bicycle, or multi-use path\nfacilities, additional signage as required by Director shall be utilized to supplement the\nrequirements of the MUTCD."
